	<h2 class="chapter title">Decisions </h2>

<div class="chaptercontent">
	<p><b class="b">P</b>anting, Aestas sprinted down the lane. Her breath hitched as cold air plunged into her lungs. It was still dark outside, the sun still sound asleep behind the sacred mountains of Dekota. Ideally, one would be snuggled up in one’s covers during these coldest hours of a spring dawn. However, Aestas was out and running about. She dashed down the stone-paved stairs that led down to the coast below Annyo city, praying that she would get to the port on time.
	</p>
	<p>As she pushed through the fog, she recognized a familiar figure standing at the end of the dock. Her heart soared as it dropped.
	</p>
	<p>“Wait,” she cried softly, keeping her voice down, in fear of waking up the whole harbor, “don’t go.”
	</p>
	<p>The tall figure turned around, catching her faint call and rapid footsteps.
	</p>
	<p>“Aestas!” the person exclaimed, voice low, “whatever are you doing here?!”
	</p>
	<p>“Tsahn!” she plunged into his embrace, “how could you just leave me like that— not even saying goodbye?”
	</p>
	<p>“What do you mean?” Tsahn asked, sounding puzzled, as he held her firmly in his arms, “I thought by sneaking out this early, that you would still be sound asleep.”
	</p>
	<p>Aestas lifted her face and glared at him accusingly, “I don’t care if it’s a requirement for the secret mission or not, you, of all people, should still report to me before you leave for the search!”
	</p>
	<p>The troubled look on Tsahn’s face gradually cleared, as a wave of realization took over him. 
	</p>
	<p>“Oh—” he said, chuckling quietly, “you thought I was the one sailing out today.”
	</p>
	<p>“Is it not you, then?” Aestas’ face lit up with delight, and relief washed over her.
	</p>
	<p>She had woken with a start, when she thought she heard the heavy doors of the Nix opening in her sleep. And had crept down the halls to Tsahn’s room after minutes of contemplation. When there was no reply upon her rapid knocks on the door, she hurried to the ground floor, only to find the guards locking up the doors once again. They reported to Aestas, after she drilled them with questions, that the young master Aouthyerhl had left the residence almost half an hour ago. Her face drained of colour when she somehow connected Tsahn’s sudden departure to the secret search she had requested Esen Ventus to conduct. 
	</p>
	<p>Regarding the operation, all identities and locations of the agents that Lieutenant Ventus had recruited, were classified, and kept from everyone, including Aestas Hyacinth herself. 
	</p>
	<p>It was a term from the Lieutenant, to insure that his corps would be safe, if the business were to be exposed one day. 
	</p>
	<p>The young Hyacinth had eventually agreed that she would never, under any circumstances, make an enquiry into three of the Ws— who, where, and when. However, when it did occur to her that Aurelius Solicas and Tsahn Aouthyerhl could be possible recruits, she had been restless since. 
	</p>
	<p>And she was correct. 
	</p>
	<p>Just after the winter program for primary trainees was complete, Esen Ventus had summoned both Solicas and Aouthyerhl to his office respectively. Every graduate that reached the qualification, as mentioned before, would head out to the different advanced centers for further training. There was another way, although rarely used, was for training superiors, which were mostly second and first lieutenants, to hand pick trainees to become their direct subordinates, or in other words, apprentice. These students were then trained directly under the wing of respective masters. 
	</p>
	<p>The custom was, on a veracious account, a toil for both master and student, due to the fact that the requirements to become an official R.A. member would then become even more rigorous, as a means of preventing unmoral deals under the table. It was believed that no true personal benefit came from the system. Therefore, the practice had played itself out over the years.
	</p>
	<p>Esen Ventus, on the other hand, being the ambitious gambler as he was, decided that it would be the best cover up for the secret operation.
	</p>
	<p>It was, however, to his dismay, both Solicas and Aouthyerhl refused his proposal unexpectedly.
	</p>
	<p class="p">“You’re not going?” Aurelius had asked Tsahn, bewildered.
	</p>
	<p>“You’re not, too.”
	</p>
	<p>“Well, that’s true.” 
	</p>
	<p>After considering the fact that no good ever comes from the weird apprentice custom, Aurelius had decided that it would be best to join the advanced centers. 
	</p>
	<p>“But <i>your</i> decision is a big surprise,” he said, giving Tsahn a sidelong glance, “and here I thought <i>you</i> were the one that firmly believes that she’s still out there.”
	</p>
	<p>Tsahn met his eye and smiled painfully. “I still do,” he replied.
	</p>
	<p>“Then why not? As much as Ventus is a jerk with his oh so filling confidence and those sugar coated words, he actually is trustworthy.”
	</p>
	<p>It wouldn’t be some scam or a trap, was what he meant.
	</p>
	<p>“I know.”
	</p>
	<p>“This is your way to freedom, Tsahn,” Aurelius said. And he was right. It is a chance for Tsahn to leave the citadel.
	</p>
	<p><i>“I know.” </i>
	</p>
	<p>So what was Tsahn hesitating for? Neither Aurelius nor Esen Ventus could wrap a finger around it. They all knew that Tsahn had been reaching for this opportunity all his life.
	</p>
	<p>Tsahn jerked his head away and hid his face. The soul-crushing feeling of his wings being clipped crept through his body all over again. 
	</p>
	<p>Aurelius studied the other. 
	</p>
	<p>There must be a reasonable cause of Tsahn’s refusal… 
	</p>
	<p><i>And then it hit him—</i>
	</p>
	<p>“It’s Aestas, isn’t it?”
	</p>
	<p>And Aurelius was right, <i>again</i>.
	</p>
	<p>“I can’t leave her like this,” Tsahn said, devastated, “I am like an older brother to her, and she my little sister. If I leave her now, when she had just lost her sister, she would then be truly alone.” 
	</p>
	<p class="p">“So you really are not going, Tsahn?” Aestas clung to him, “you’re staying?”
	</p>
	<p>“Yes, little one,” he smiled down at her, although his eyes held a slight shade of pain. “I won’t be going anywhere. I’m staying here, at Annyo, with you.”
	</p>
	<p>She hugged him tightly, relieved and happy.
	</p>
	<p>“Then why are you here at the harbor so early in the morning?” she asked, gazing up at him adoringly. 
	</p>
	<p>Tsahn held an arm around her shoulders as his gaze drifted off over the misty surface of the inner seas. 
	</p>
	<p>“I came to say goodbye to a dear friend,” he murmured, “but from the looks of it, I didn’t get here on time.”
	</p>
	<p>Aestas thought it weird. It couldn’t be Aurelius, for she knew perfectly well of where he stood on the matter of her sister’s situation. Also, she had requested Lieutenant Ventus to keep the operation from the general’s son specifically.
	</p>
	<p>Nevertheless, she wanted to wipe the sorrow away from Tsahn’s face. “They’ll come back,” Aestas said, wanting to comfort the older.
	</p>
	<p>He chuckled, “well, I guess you’re right.”
	</p>
	<p>She slipped her hands into his. Both of their hands were warm despite the coldness of the early dawn of spring.
	</p>
	<p>“Come on,” she said, giving his hand a slight tug.
	</p>
	<p>After one last longing glimpse of the open seas, Tsahn complied.
	</p>
	<p>“Alright, little one,” he said, giving her hand a little squeeze, “let’s go home.”
	</p>
	<p>Aestas smiled, a warm and fuzzy feeling gradually filled her heart. For the first time after what seemed like forever, she felt like she had been saved; finally safe, and away from the lonely, dark place she had been stranded in for so long.
	</p>
	<p>“When do you think the hyacinths would be in full bloom?” she asked Tsahn as he led her up the stone-paved steps.
	</p>
	<p>“Springtime has come,” he mused, “so any day now.”
	</p><br>
	<p class="p">Fae Baykartte was terrified when Esen Ventus cornered her at the end of the hallway. Not that she was afraid of the man, but rather nervous of what he got to say.
	</p>
	<p>She and this particular second lieutenant of the windriders department had grown familiar with each other, due to the multiple missions they somehow both ended up to be a part of. He was cute, and confident. There was definitely some flirtiness and tension between the two, but with so much going on in the citadel these days, Fae was certain that she would rather not engage in any romantical affairs.
	</p>
	<p>The serious look in Esen Ventus’ eyes petrified her, and as he leaned in, she swore that she could’ve blacked out for a moment.
	</p>
	<p>“Can I come by your office after this meeting?” he whispered in her ear.
	</p>
	<p>“What?” she sputtered, “no! And don’t talk to me like this, do you not see where we are at?” She tried to duck out of his control, but he slammed another arm on the wall, blocking her way.
	</p>
	<p>“Please,” he whined. “I have something important to tell you.”
	</p>
	<p><i>In that case, definitely NO. </i>
	</p>
	<p>Fae was just about to refuse when out of the corner of her eye, she saw that a few of his subordinates were looking her way. She recognized the windriders, as some were the annoying subjects that dared pursue her. Irritation grew as she remembered how they loved to send flowers and cards to her office, which she threw away immediately in disgust. 
	</p>
	<p>Well, if Esen were to approach her like this, he might as well be useful. 
	</p>
	<p>She reached out, after a split glance at the windriders, and pulled Esen closer by the straps of his cloak.
	</p>
	<p>“In that case,” she said, gazing into his clear black eyes, all the while making sure that the others saw her smile, “you are more than welcome.”
	</p>
	<p>The astonishment in Esen’s widened eyes was soon replaced with amusement, when he glanced over his shoulder to where Fae Baykartte’s glances landed.
	</p>
	<p><i>Such a success—</i> she cheered to herself when the windriders turned away, sulking. 
	</p>
	<p>He let out a little laugh as she pushed him away gently. 
	</p>
	<p>“I see what you did there,” he chuckled, “so this cute little gesture of yours, is to get rid of the flies?”
	</p>
	<p>“Sorry,” she said sheepishly.
	</p>
	<p>“Oh— it’s alright. I’m more than honored to be the repellent, your shield,” Esen drawled.
	</p>
	<p>“I’d rather you be gone,” Fae hissed, though her grayish pink eyes glistened with rare laughter.
	</p>
	<p>“But in all earnesty,” he said, unfazed, still not letting her go, “can I swing by your office later? I have someone I want to introduce you to, or rather, introduce you to that someone.”
	</p>
	<p>Fae’s heart pounded as she furrowed her eyebrows.
	</p>
	<p>“It’s someone important,” Ventus said, enjoying the way the ivory haired swordswomen squirmed nervously. 
	</p>
	<p>“Lieutenants,” a deep voice cut in, interrupting the scene, “we are ready for you inside.”
	</p>
	<p>Both Fae Baykartte and Esen Ventus turned to see a handsome-looking swordsman. Fae silently thanked her savior for his courage, and watched in amusement as Ventus immediately fixed his predator-like stare on the intruder.
	</p>
	<p>“Isn’t <i>this</i> my favorite prey?” he exclaimed, letting go of Fae, who slipped away at the chance. 
	</p>
	<p><i>“Brontes Laers,”</i> Esen Ventus drawled, voice dripping with honey, as he stepped towards the young swordsman. 
	</p>
	<p>“I see that you’re not hiding it anymore,” Brontes snarled, <i>“‘prey,’</i> is it? Does it give you a boost of confidence? Picking on an innocent officer like me.”
	</p>
	<p>The sides of Esen’s lips curled upwards, and he hummed with delight, enjoying the hatred that Laers held in his eyes. He knew that the officer was jealous of him, as a windrider, and as a lieutenant. He glanced and saw Ivian Lena peering around the door. His smile grew wider as he locked eyes with her. 
	</p>
	<p><i>Two little dragons, one stone.</i>
	</p>
	<p>“No,” he said, stepping closer to Laers, who stood his ground. “It gives me a boost of dopamine,” he went on, grinning into the fierce green eyes of the other, aware that Lena was also gritting her teeth at the sight. 
	</p>
	<p>The relationship between Laers and Lena has always left him perplexed, yet weirdly entertained. The pair seemed to loathe one another, but when it came to facing Esen Ventus, it was as if they would become instant allies without second thought. Esen found it fascinating just by observing their interactions and reactions, while Laers’ well known jealousy towards the windriders only added color to the fun.
	</p>
	<p>Esen Ventus smirked as he tilted up the chin of the snarling young officer. “It gives me satisfaction,” he drawled, “to know that I am the subject of your jealousy. And that you have no power before me.”
	</p>
	<p>“In your dreams,” Laers hissed, refusing to back down, “and don’t you pull rank on me.” He grabbed onto the finger, away from his face, and gave it a hard shove. 
	</p>
	<p>Ventus only gazed smugly down at Laers, as if enjoying himself. A kick from behind caused him to turn, however, breaking eye contact with his prey. 
	</p>
	<p>Brontes Laers let out a small sigh of relief, as Ventus stepped away.
	</p>
	<p>“Quit flirting with my officer and let us get to work,” Lieutenant Baykartte said. Esen Ventus followed after her like a large puppy.
	</p>
	<p><i>“I owe you one,”</i> Baykartte mouthed to officer Laers, who was looking as flustered as he was furious.
	</p>
	<p>An afternoon of education for the officers on the recent events and strategies lay ahead of them. Fae only prayed that the windriders and swordsmen don’t end up in a group fight.
	</p>
	<p>“If it’s really serious business you have to discuss,” Fae said to Esen, before entering the meeting room, “I suppose I’ll allow you to come by.” 
	</p>
	<p>She still feared what he had to say. It better be nothing that would ruin their so called “friendship.”
	</p>
	<p>“Don’t worry,” Esen said, with that radiant smile on his face, for he knew what she was worrying about.
	</p>
	<p>“I’ll behave,” he said, laughing, “It will be nothing but <i>serious business</i> that comes out of my mouth, I promise.”
	</p><br>
	<p class="p">Fae Baykartte was yet again, terrified, with the culprit being Esen Ventus. 
	</p>
	<p>Although this time, it was not what he said, nor what he did to her, but because of the person he brought into her office, and the words that came out of that person’s mouth.
	</p>
	<p class="p">Fae had to go through the events in her mind again to recover from the shock—
	</p>
	<p class="p">First of all, the “important person” Esen Ventus said he wanted to introduce to her, was not his friend, nor a family member, but none other than the young heir to the throne— Aestas Hyacinth. The sixteen year old stood there, looking energetic in her vanilla colored spring dress, and gazed imploringly at Fae Baykartte with those bright, lime, green eyes.
	</p>
	<p>“Tell her to stop looking at me like that,” Fae murmured, reaching out to Esen, hand trembling, “it’s too bright and too warm. I might go blind, or burn, or melt.”
	</p>
	<p>Esen merely grinned. “She has that effect on people,” he said, patting the young Hyacinth on the shoulder. Fae swore that she could see glitter flying off of the girl. 
	</p>
	<p class="p">Secondly, the “serious business” Esen Ventus mentioned that he wanted to discuss, was not about his feelings, nor about their relationship <i>(yikes)</i>, but none other than an operation that he had been secretly carrying out for the past months— an underground search for the traces left of Candentia Hyacinth. The ins and outs of the matter rolled off of his tongue as effortlessly as the usual frivolous words, as if he were not describing the most insane and risky behaviour.
	</p>
	<p>“Are you out of your mind?” Fae shouted in a whisper, “that is defying the king’s direct orders for goodness sake!”
	</p>
	<p>Esen merely shrugged. “That’s what I told this little princess,” he said, patting the young Hyacinth on the head. Fae sneezed. She was allergic to sunshine and roses.
	</p>
	<p class="p">As to the third point, the “mastermind” behind the proposal of the secret mission, was not an experienced R.A. member, nor Esen Ventus himself, but a teenage girl. Aestas Hyacinth’ smile was ever so bright, that it was as if nothing tragic had ever happened; her gaze so innocent, as if it were not she, who had laid out a path paved with thorns before the lieutenants. 
	</p>
	<p>“Is this some type of prank?” she asked them, “because if it is, it’s working. I am terrified.”
	</p>
	<p>Esen shook his head. “Unfortunately, it’s not. I did promise you that there would be nothing but serious business.”
	</p>
	<p class="p">Finally, the main reason Fae Baykartte was on the brink of malfunctioning, was not because of the fact that Aestas Hyacinth was in her office, nor the truth about Esen’s engagement in a secret operation, but the fact that she had just been asked to join the mission. Both of the guests in her office looked as if they were talking about something as light as which type of jam was best to use on their toast.
	</p>
	<p>“Why me?” Fae murmured, feeling faint, “you are putting me in <i>such</i> a difficult position.”
	</p>
	<p>Esen gave Aestas a sidelong glance. “You see?” he said, slightly pouting, “it’s not only me who would say that. Any sensible person would know that stepping into the mission is like putting their life on the line.”
	</p>
	<p>“But you agreed,” Aestas grinned with triumph. She seriously didn’t consider anything she asked of Lieutenant Ventus to be dangerous in any kind of way. If the mission really did get exposed, and her father learned of it, she could just plead with him to let them off lightly, and all will be fine.
	</p>
	<p>“I did refuse at first,” Ventus said, defeat laced his voice, “but now that I am six feet deep into the business, I have come to the realization that I couldn’t really handle all of this while dealing with the official burdens by myself.”
	</p>
	<p>“You need a partner in crime,” Fae concluded through gritted teeth.
	</p>
	<p>“That’s right.”
	</p>
	<p>“But then again,” she said, “why me? You could’ve asked any of your fellow officials, whom you are much closer with.”
	</p>
	<p>“You know why,” he grinned, trying to tease his way out.
	</p>
	<p>“I’ll have to hear you say it,” Fae said. Although by this point, he had made his reason obvious, she wasn’t going to back down so easily. 
	</p>
	<p><i>Tell me that you trust me.</i>
	</p>
	<p>She knew that he wasn’t the type to say it, but nevertheless, she thought that he had to pay some price. Not that she would forgive him for dragging her down with him, but that it would be satisfying to hear, and would smooth her resentment. 
	</p>
	<p>He stuttered, trying to tell her that he did, in fact, trust her enough to come to her with a proposal containing this level of craziness.
	</p>
	<p>“I’ll do you the favor,” Aestas cut in, growing impatient with the two. She had better things to do. If Esen Ventus can’t spit out whatever he needed to say, to get the ivory haired swordswomen on his team, she would do it for him. 
	</p>
	<p>“He relies on you, he trusts you, he loves you,” she rambled on, “is that about it, Lieutenants?”
	</p>
	<p>Fae Baykartte looked rather startled. 
	</p>
	<p>The young Hyacinth only smiled again ever so sweetly. 
	</p>
	<p>“Young ones these days,” Esen muttered. And Fae was mortified, for she saw that Esen Ventus was blushing. 
	</p>
	<p>“Hell,” she hissed at Ventus, while heat rushed up into her own neck and face, “get a hold of yourself.” 
	</p>
	<p>Esen coughed as he adjusted his uniform, all the while looking anywhere but Fae’s face.
	</p>
	<p>“The <b><i>“trust”</i></b> part is about right,” he said finally.
	</p><br>
	<p class="p">Aestas and Shardow hopped off the cable car as soon as it arrived at the main entrance to Annyo city, which is situated at the far west of Sarnts. Aestas skipped along the path towards the northwest corner of Munro woods, with the long, low wall on her right and Shardow jogging ahead. 
	</p>
	<p>As they passed by the agricultural district— Darcca, the rumbling of the waterfalls started growing louder and louder. 
	</p>
	<p>“Almost halfway there!” Shardow shouted over his shoulder.
	</p>
	<p>They soon arrived at a bridge that ran over one of the distributaries of the western branch of the River Dekota.
	</p>
	<p>“Shardow!” Aestas called. “Wait!”
	</p>
	<p>Shardow stopped in his tracks and turned around. He grinned as he watched Aestas run to the side, climb up to the top of the wall, and fling her upper body over the railing. Her eyes lit up as she took in the view. 
	</p>
	<p>The waters of the three broad rivers that ran through the district were like three straight silver arrows, shooting from the east and plunging down the steep cliff west of Darcca. 
	</p>
	<p>“Isn’t it great? That the first thing people see when they are entering Annyo is the magnificence of the waterfalls,” Aestas said, when Shardow appeared beside her.
	</p>
	<p>“It’s sure a sight,” Shardow said with a laugh, “great for shocking visitors.”
	</p>
	<p>“I’m proud of our capital,” Aestas said, pride filling her chest as she took in a deep breath.
	</p>
	<p>She giggled happily when the fresh scent of damp grass and water splashed up, and sprinkled down on her in the form of countless small droplets. Behind her, the fields and farmlands of the district— Darcca, spread out the terrace, until reaching the tall wall, stopping just before the hills that rolled further up the land. 
	</p>
	<p>Things were going great these days, despite the grave situations. 
	</p>
	<p>If she looked past the fact that the problems between the co-rulers of Land Hyacinthous were still out of control, it was as if everything she required these days was within her reach; everything she instructed had been falling into place, going smoothly according to her plans.
	</p>
	<p>Time heals, as the saying goes; or rather, as Candentia always said. And Aestas somehow believed it to be true.
	</p>
	<p>She hadn’t been able to get rid of the sting of sorrow and guilt out of her chest completely. But she was feeling better, with her friends and Tsahn by her side. 
	</p>
	<p>It meant the world to her that Tsahn had chosen to stay and look after her, rather than sailing out and participating in the search. And although the pressure she had always been under hadn’t resided, she felt like she was heading in the right direction, step by step; picking up the broken parts, piece by piece.
	</p>
	<p>Aestas and Shardow soon arrived at the edge of the city, where a slim auburn-haired lad stood waiting for them by the wall.
	</p>
	<p>“Akti!” Aestas ran to him, “we’re here!”
	</p>
	<p>“Yo,” Shardow said, giving Akti a bump in the shoulder, “sorry for being late. Aestas here was stalling.”
	</p>
	<p>“I was not,” Aestas retorted, and gave her friend a pinch.
	</p>
	<p>Akti stepped aside, creating a distance between himself and his bickering friends.
	</p>
	<p>“How’s Tsahn Aouthyerhl doing?” Akti asked, suddenly thinking about the older lad.
	</p>
	<p>Due to his brother’s departure for further training after his graduation from the winter program, he had thought that Tsahn Aouthyerhl would do the same. It was to his surprise, that the hazel eyed lad appeared to have chosen another path, and went on about as he had done for the past decade. Akti knew how close Tsahn Aouthyerhl had been with Candentia and Aurelius. With both of them gone, Akti was slightly worried about the lad’s well being.
	</p>
	<p>Upon the sudden question, both Aestas and Shardow stopped their movements. 
	</p>
	<p>“I suppose he’s doing fine,” Aestas said, pondering, her hands still grabbing onto Shardow’s caramel blond strands of hair. She smiled at the thought of Tsahn.
	</p>
	<p>“He is busy training under the swordsmen department I think.”
	</p>
	<p>“I don’t really know how it works, but isn’t he only a primary trainee?” Shardow asked. “Can he do that?”
	</p>
	<p>“He’s special,” was all Aestas could say.
	</p>
	<p>It was true. Tsahn Aouthyerhl did have some special treatment.
	</p>
	<p>Despite his refusal to Ventus’ proposal of becoming his apprentice, Tsahn had been receiving one-on-one lessons from Fae Baykartte and Esen Ventus. It was a resume of his usual training that he had with Candentia. He pushed himself extremely hard, and was improving in a way he never did before.
	</p><br>
	<p class="p">That night, Tshan woke up with a start.
	</p>
	<p><i>Again. </i>
	</p>
	<p>Breathing hard, he climbed down his bed and sat down in front of the desk by the window. He lay a hand on a stack of books he had just borrowed that evening, searching for any sense of comfort.
	</p>
	<p>Apart from combat training, Tsahn also spent a large amount of time in the royal library. It never was where his interest lay, but tagging along Candentia and Aurelius for almost half of his lifetime, he had somehow grown fond of the smell of books. And staying at the place that his two friends had loved, was the only way he could soothe the throbbing pain that churned his chest almost constantly.
	</p>
	<p>The cover of the books felt cool against his palm. His heart, contrary to the calming sensation that passed through his fingers, burned.
	</p>
	<p>“What’s the use?” he hissed to himself, standing up.
	</p>
	<p>With a sudden movement, Tsahn swung open his drawer, grabbed the letter that was stored carefully within and flung it at the wall. 
	</p>
	<p>The brown paper fluttered, never hitting the intended destination, and fell to the floor. 
	</p>
	<p>Tsahn clenched his jaw. 
	</p>
	<p>He should have burned it by now, but couldn’t muster up the determination to set it to flames. The piece of wrinkled paper had been sitting in the drawer ever since he came back from the port that dawn.
	</p>
	<p>Upon the rising of another moon, there was just enough light to make out the words written in perfect cursive handwriting:
	</p>
	<div class="aureliusletter">
		<p class="aureliusletternames">Dear Tsahn,
		</p>
		<div class="aureliuslettercontent">
			<p>I understand.
			</p>
			<p>The reason you decided to stay.
			</p>
			<p>C. would be grateful, if she were here, to know the extent you are going, to take care of her dearest sister.
			</p>
			<p class="p">But I also understand.
			</p>
			<p>Your desire to leave, and how you yearn to participate in the mission.
			</p>
			<p>And I know it is not only because you wish to fly out of your cage, but it is also to fly to her.
			</p>
			<p>And it pains me to see you in agony, knowing the feelings of not being able to fulfill your dreams, nor chase after your beliefs.
			</p>
			<p class="p">Therefore, dear friend. 
			</p>
			<p>If your wings are tied, and you cannot fly.
			</p>
			<p>I will do it for you. 
			</p>
			<p class="p">Take good care of Aestas.
			</p>
			<p>And know that the flames of your hopes of finding C., are safe, and would be carried on with me.
			</p>
			<p>Although I still stand by my previous statements, and refuse to raise my own hopes up as you did so foolishly, I will do the best I can to bring any fragments that are left of her back to you. 
			</p>
			<p class="p">I will leave at dawn. 
			</p>
			<p>My sincere apologies for not being able to say goodbye in person. Orders from Ventus.
			</p>
			<p>But I wish you all the best.
			</p>
			<p class="p">Farewell, for now.
			</p>
			<p>And take care.
			</p>
