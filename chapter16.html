<div class="chaptercontent">
	<p><b class="b">L</b>ansher Coulnaur Hellebore had successfully captured one of his targets— Candentia Hyacinth, but to his own dismay— had failed to take the younger heir of Hyacinthous with him as well.
	</p>
	<p class="p">Blending into the citadel was easy, as it was the time of the annual summer festival, and the main castle grounds were open to the public. There <i>were</i> multiple checkpoints Lansher Hellebore had to go through, but he <i>had</i> come prepared— in fact, he had undergone serious training for almost his whole life, with the sole purpose of executing <i>this</i> particular mission— several checkpoints weren’t going to stop him. With the most perfectly-crafted forged-documents, and a tiny bit of illusion spells, he slipped into the citadel without having to lift a finger or cause any suspicion— yes, he had also been under severe enchantment training, which was so harsh that he almost had his life taken away from him several times, and had thus become powerful enough to overwrite the safety coded enchantments of the Citadel walls and its guards. 
	</p>
	<p>He had been wandering around the palace on the first day of the festival, observing and memorizing the layout and shifts of the main castle grounds. 
	</p>
	<p>It was his first time out of the North… well… actually… the second time if he was to be precise— he had snuck out of the border while hiding in a cargo box when he was only eight— such a rebellious and adventurous kid back then. He was, unfortunately, found immediately when they landed in the Western Lands, and was sent back to the North at once. His father— king Hellebore the 5th, nearly went insane after he heard what his son had done. 
	</p>
	<p>Lansher Hellebore shivered uncontrollably as he remembered the cold and damp dungeon he had been thrown into afterwards as his punishment.
	</p>
	<p class="p">“He seemed terrified,” Jashi Hellebore had whispered to the eight year old Lansher. Jashi is one of Lansher’s twin sisters that was six seasons older than him (meaning that they had the age gap of one and a half years). She had also been thrown into the dark dungeon, where Lansher had been locked up and beaten daily. 
	</p>
	<p>Lansher remembered how his older sister’s voice was quivering at that time— “and I feel like it’s about something really bad,” she had whispered to Lansher.
	</p>
	<p>“I followed him yesterday into the woods behind the castle and to the forbidden fountain—”
	</p>
	<p>Although it was too dark for Lansher to see, he knew by the long pauses and shaken breathing— that tears were running down his sister’s face. 
	</p>
	<p>He sat in silence as Jashi Hellebore kept on talking.
	</p>
	<p>“I— I hid behind some bushes when I overheard him talking to someone,” she paused again, “ <i>— or something… </i>I don't know…. the other voice sounded really weird and creepy, like it was made of ice and shadow.”
	</p>
	<p>“What were they talking about?” Lansher finally asked. 
	</p>
	<p>He winced as he spoke— his lip had been cut and was bleeding, and his whole body was still in pain from the beating he had gotten that evening. 
	</p>
	<p>“If my ears weren’t mistaken— father was begging that <i>thing</i> to let you live!” the ten-year old shuddered, “he sounded really, really scared— as if the thing was going to kill him, or <i>kill you</i>, Lansher.”
	</p>
	<p>“ — what did the thing say, Jashi?” little Lansher started to cry. He didn’t know that he could get himself into this much trouble, and regretted how he let his curiosity get the best of him. 
	</p>
	<p>“Will I get killed?” he whimpered.
	</p>
	<p>Jashi hiccuped, trying to cease her crying, “I only heard the thing say, ‘under one condition,’” she sobbed, “and then someone grabbed me from behind and Father yelled for me to get thrown down here with you.”
	</p>
	<p>Under one condition— meaning that whatever was to be laid in front of Lansher Coulnaur Hellebore, he was to endure and do as he was told, just to act as an exchange, for his own life to be spared.
	</p>
	<p>It was soon introduced to the Hellebore heirs that the ‘thing’ their father was asking for mercy that day, by the forbidden fountain, is a powerful demon, summoned by their grandfather over a decade ago, on which he relied, in order to expand the Hellebore territory. It was stated clearly to the young Hellebore heirs that ‘the one condition’ the demon mentioned that day, was for Jashi and Henitah Hellebore to learn dark sorcery, and for Lansher to train until he was a walking weapon. It turned out that the one mission he had for his life was to become deadly enough to defeat a whole squad of royal swordsmen, break into the castle walls of the Citadel of Annyo, and capture the two heirs of the Hyacinth throne and take them back to the North alive. It was told to the Hellebores that it was the only way they could bargain for the removal of the boundary spell casted upon their land. Were the spell be removed, the demon would rule planet Csettrecsran, but will grant the Hellebores their freedom. 
	</p>
	<p>The siblings were let out of the dungeon the following day, returning to the bright lights under the shining Northern crystals of the castle. And from then on— the young Hellebores were trained as heavily as assassins to be.
	</p>
	<p class="p">If he had time to spare, Lansher Coulnaur Hellebore would’ve loved to stay longer outside, and away— from the suffocating place that he felt like being held captive, and to explore the colorful places and take in the brilliant sights of the other lands. If he completed his task, would his father and the demon of the north finally grant him his most desired— his own freedom? 
	</p>
	<p class="p">Blending into the citadel was simple, getting a glimpse of the targets was easy, but to break into the top floors of the main castle was harder than he expected, but still— he was well trained and eventually took down the last guard and swordsman standing in his way. 
	</p>
	<p class="p">
	</p>
	<p><i>“Where’s your sister? Dear cousin,”</i> he asked the ashy-black-haired girl he was battling with—  talking to her ever so sweetly.
	</p>
	<p><i>“Once we collect her, we could be on our way— there's no need to shed blood right now.”</i>
	</p>
	<p>His plan was to find the younger of the two and use Aestas Hyacinth as coercion to make the first heir— Candentia Hyacinth comply. But to his dismay, the second daughter of the Hyacinth throne was nowhere to be found. And only the gray-eyed girl awaited him on the balcony of the top floor of the main castle.
	</p>
	<p><i>“You’ll have to kill me first, before you can even lay a finger on her,”</i> Candentia Hyacinth said through gritted teeth, “that— however, would lead to war. And I bet your people wouldn’t want that, <i>would they now?”</i>
	</p>
	<p>Earlier in the afternoon, during the evening event of the R.A. announcement ceremony, Candentia had a weird feeling in her gut and when she scanned the crowd below the platform, she locked eyes with a boy that looked about her age. He had a rather pale face and thin glossy lips, and looked neat and handsome in the typical Hyacinthous attire— a loose white shirt tucked into high-waisted black pants, and a plain cloak draped to either side of his shoulders. 
	</p>
	<p>It was weird though, for him to be in such normal clothes when the others around him were in colorful and exaggerated outfits for the celebration. It was the <i>eyes</i>, however, that made Candentia Hyacinth stare for a while— they were a pair of depthless gray eyes, surrounded with black lashes, and they were strikingly similar to what Candentia saw in the mirror every morning. 
	</p>
	<p>The strange lad must’ve felt the same, for he seemed to have stared longer than he had planned, and had teared his eyes away only after the sound of loud music blasted out and pulled him back to his senses. He disappeared into the crowd soon after, and Candentia had put the situation behind her back. 
	</p>
	<p>However, during the celebration of Aestas Hyacinth’s birthday at the late evening ball, the first Hyacinth heir happened to have spotted the gray-eyed lad again. Candentia Hyacinth was standing in a corner of the main ballroom, and was deep in conversation with the R.S.D. general’s son— Aurelius Solicas, and the Syarchia prince— Tsahn Aouthyerhl. 
	</p>
	<p>The trio were murmuring with each other in low voices and were arguing about what to do the day after, when the young Hyacinth noticed the mysterious boy standing in another corner, staring intently at the middle of the ballroom. 
	</p>
	<p>Candentia traced along his line of sight and discovered that it landed on the pair that was swirling around and giggling with innocent joy— it was Aestas Hyacinth and one of her friends that Candentia reckoned to be Shardow Gier due to his forest green eyes.
	</p>
	<p class="p">The first heir of Hyacinth must’ve sensed the danger enclosing on her younger sister, because right after the last dance, and when Lansher Hellebore was about to strike, he soon noticed that the young lime-green eyed heir was nowhere to be seen, as well as the two lads that were previously talking to Candentia Hyacinth. And after rounds of searching, he finally realized that the best choice for him was to trace out the footprints of powers his prey left behind and seek out the hiding princess. However, a scent of Hyacinth blood kept on fogging his senses to track the second heir, and he eventually decided, involuntarily, on the spot, that his plans had to be changed, and with his eyes and dagger both glinting dangerously in the night, he followed the scent he previously wanted to steer clear of, and had come face to face with the first heir of the Hyacinths on the balcony.
	</p>
	<p class="p">Candentia Hyacinth charged at him as she held solid eye contact, her ashy black hair flying up behind her, reflecting the dim light that flowed through the tall windows that connected the ceilings and the floors. She had taken the blades out from the side of her thighs, and was using them to defend herself.
	</p>
	<p>As well trained as she was, and she regretted to say, but Candentia Hyacinth was no match with Lansher Hellebore in the game of hand-to-hand combat. Both of them knew that although they seemed to be neck and neck when it came to agileness and skill, Lansher still had the slight advantage, not mentioning that he also had more strength than his component. With a swirl and a twirl, the two were head-to-head with each other, both with two blades in hand, reaching a stalemate. Lansher pushed, and Candentia pushed back, both panting, and glaring at one another. 
	</p>
	<p>“Good fight,” Lansher Hellebore rasped, he was waiting for the Hyacinth to wear out. 
	</p>
	<p>Candentia gave a cold laugh as she suddenly pulled back and turned to the side in case of getting slashed by the other’s blades, and she jumped far back onto the railing on one side of the balcony behind Lansher Hellebore’s back. And before the Hellebore could turn around, she hurled her daggers at him. She knew that by competing with strength, she stood no chance, and put her bets on her speed and aim.
	</p>
	<p>But even with his back turned, Lansher had sensed the danger and acted just in time— he spun sideways to dodge the first and did a side flip to dodge the other, his movements smooth and graceful as if he were only dancing. Lansher raised his eyebrows at Candentia, and smiled smugly as if to gloat. However, to his own surprise, he then winced as he felt a throbbing pain on the side of his left arm. A damp feeling of warm liquid spread from the spot and drenched his sleeve. He looked down— it was blood, and it was oozing out of his newly cut arm.
	</p>
	<p>His opponent saw this opportunity and pranced from the railing she was perched on, and barged toward him— hand raised and palms open. 
	</p>
	<p>A hint of annoyance flashed through Lansher’s eyes as he prepared for the crash, but was soon taken by subtle surprise when he noticed the ice-blue, dim light forming in Candentia Hyacinth’s palms. Lansher raised both his arms up and held them in a cross in front of his face— just in time to weave a power shield. An explosion shook the palace grounds as spears made of ice shattered into a million pieces, the icy debris spaying wildly in all directions. 
	</p>
	<p><i>“My, my—”</i> he said, lowering his arms as he took a step back, “so <i>that’s</i> the power of the first heir of the Hyacinth.”
	</p>
	<p>“That’s not even half of it,” Candentia sneered.
	</p>
	<p><i>“Is that so— ?”</i> Lansher smirked. His eyes held a glint of what Candentia swore was happy playfulness. 
	</p>
	<p>Her palm glowed with the same ice-blue glow again, but this time, a dagger made of ice was held in place. And she charged at him once more—
	</p>
	<p>Blades clashed and clanged, the reflections of the remaining light of the towers bounced off the metal and onto the walls as shouts and calls came nearer and nearer. It seems that some of the guards he had knocked unconscious had already come to. 
	</p>
	<p><i>“Tsk,”</i> Lansher Coulnaur Hellebore clicked his tongue. Playtime’s over.
	</p><br>
	<p class="p">Candentia Hyacinth hissed. The back of her waist was pressed against the railing and her hand that once held a weapon was now deeply cut and held still by Lansher Hellebore.
	</p>
	<p>“So much for <i>‘only half of it,’”</i> he laughed heartily, fingers digging her wrist while the blade cut deeper into her skin.
	</p>
	<p>The Hyacinth tried to use her free hand to form temporary weapons, but the Hellebore acted faster. Within a blink of an eye, Lansher had both of Candentia’s hands held behind her own back, stomach pressed against the railing, and a dagger held to her throat. The girl coughed out of discomfort and breathed hard.
	</p>
	<p>“I'll ask you one last time, <i>princess,</i>” Lansher said, pushing his blade dangerously closer, “where’s your dear sister?”
	</p>
	<p>“She’s hidden far away— somewhere safe within more layers of protection,” Candentia Hyacinth replied calmly, “and I doubt you can handle the <i>both</i> of us without getting taken down by the R.A. before making it out of the Citadel.” 
	</p>
	<p>“And—” she took a sidelong glance at Lansher, “by attacking the R.A. directly— is a declaration of war, which—” she took yet again a dramatic pause—
	</p>
	<p>“Judging by your actions, it’s certainly what you are trying to avoid. Besides, with the boundary enchantment holding the North in place, you wouldn’t even stand a chance, and would be leveled to the ground,” she snarled.
	</p>
	<p>Lansher said nothing and listened to the clatter and frantic shouts that seemed to be getting closer. He better move fast. 
	</p>
	<p>“So I guess there’s no chance of a plus one?” he asked, tone light, calculating the gain and losses of only bringing back one heir…
	</p>
	<p>“Tsk,” Lansher clicked his tongue out of annoyance as he came to the conclusion of his next step.
	</p>
	<p>“Yup,” Candentia smirked, reading Lansher’s mind, 
	</p>
	<p class="p"><i>“It’s me or nothing.”</i>
	</p><br>
	<p class="p">“Lansher!” someone had cried out, their voice muffled.
	</p>
	<p>The sound of the heavy door opened from above and footsteps rushed down and stopped abruptly at the bottom of the dungeon.
	</p>
	<p>“Lansher, Lansher!” the same voice repeated over and over again.
	</p>
	<p>It must be a dream, Candentia thought to herself, for the voice seemed to be so close but at the same time— so far away.
	</p>
	<p>“That’s one of the Hyacinths isn’t it?” a voice almost identical to the first sounded. If it weren’t for the much colder tone, one would’ve thought that it was the same person talking. 
	</p>
	<p>“I suppose so,” the softer voice answered, and Candentia Hyacinth felt the air around her shift as the person crept closer. She soon felt a pair of soft hands on her shoulders, shaking them gently. 
	</p>
	<p>“Oh, Jashi, what should we do? They’re both not responding. Are they still alive—?” the soft voice sounded again, this time right next to Candentia’s face.
	</p>
	<p>“Henitah, move aside,” the one called Jashi said, “this will do the trick.”
	</p>
	<p>“What are you — ah!” 
	</p>
	<p>Henitah jumped aside with a small shriek and Candentia felt a sudden strong splash of freezing water on her face— the harsh force and stinging cold woke her up entirely. Candentia Hyacinth sputtered and choked as she opened her eyelids— her own bare feet came into view as her vision gradually cleared. She blinked slowly. Through her tangled black hair and eyelashes, she noticed how filthy her legs and feet were, and how they were covered in dirt and traces of blood. The water dripped from her hair, face and clothes, and dribbled to the floor, creating dark puddles that reflected the cold light of the crystal lanterns held in the hands of Jashi and Henitah— the twin sisters of Lansher Coulnaur Hellebore— the first and second heir to the Northern throne.
	</p>
	<p>“These Northern dungeons sure live up to their name,” Candentia Hyacinth rasped between coughs— every bone and muscle aching through the production of every word. Her sight was still blurry, as well as her mind— her head was in throbbing pain.
	</p>
	<p>“You’re getting what you deserve,” the cold voice that belonged to Jashi Hellebore sounded.
	</p>
	<p>Candentia winched as a hand grabbed her chin— cold fingers and sharp nails dug into the sides of her cheeks as her face was jerked up with force. She was met with a pair of fierce violet eyes.
	</p>
	<p>“Gray eyes, just like Lansher’s,” Jashi Hellebore said, “you two could actually pass as siblings, you know?”
	</p>
	<p>“...” Candentia Hyacinth didn’t reply. That wasn’t really a question, after all.
	</p>
	<p>“Looks like she’s still torn from the torture,” Jashi said to Henitah, “tsk— weaker than I thought,” she let go of the girl and turned to the other side of the room.
	</p>
	<p><i>“What are you doing?!”</i> a cry from Henitah Hellebore rang out in the dungeon as another splash of water could be heard.
	</p>
	<p>Candentia lifted her eyes and saw in surprise that from across the room, choking while coughing water out— was Lansher. He was cuffed to the ceiling in the same position as she was, with his clothes drenched, and hair wet. <i>Why would she do that?</i> Candentia was puzzled. <i>Aren’t they on the same side?</i>
	</p>
	<p>“Why would you do that?” Henitah Hellebore sounded perplexed and worried.
	</p>
	<p>“There’s no time waste. He has to wake up. <i>Now or never,</i>” Jashi Hellebore simply shrugged.
	</p>
	<p>“Ja…shi…” Lansher coughed weakly, “I—”
	</p>
	<p>“You failed your task, dear brother.” The tone of Jashi Hellebore’s voice had a hint of resentment.
	</p>
	<p>“I… I’m sorry,” Lansher rasped.
	</p>
	<p>“You should be,” she said with visible pain in her eyes, “you've prepared this all your life. What went wrong?” 
	</p>
	<p>The only sound that answered her was the rhythmic dripping of water. Jashi sighed.
	</p>
	<p>“I fear for your life, Lansher,” she said with a softer tone, “I don’t know what type of punishment lies ahead of you.”
	</p>
	<p>Lansher raised his eyes to meet his sister’s and gave her a weak, ghosty smile.
	</p>
	<p>“It's beautiful out there,” he whispered instead.
	</p>
	<p>Jashi stared at her younger brother.
	</p>
	<p>“The weather is warm, the sunlight’s golden, and the flowers— ” he let out a long sigh, “— are blooming in so many colors, I thought I was walking in a dream.”
	</p>
	<p>“Oh, Lansher,” Henitah hugged him gently. 
	</p>
	<p>“Careful there,” Lansher laughed painfully, “you wouldn’t want your dress to be stained by blood.” 
	</p>
	<p>“And I’m sorry I couldn’t get us out of this hellhole.”
	</p>
	<p>“Lansher—” Henitah started.
	</p>
	<p>“Ahh, so my sister and I, we were supposed to be your tickets to freedom?” The heir of Hyacinthous cut in from across the room, “kind of selfish of you, isn’t it?”
	</p>
	<p>Two out of the three Hellebore siblings returned the glare.
	</p>
	<p>“Your people casted the boundary spell and left us in suffering,” Jashi spat, “what do you expect? That we would sit back and endure everything? Or did you think that we would simply forgive you with a warm heart?”
	</p>
	<p>“My land did whatever we could to protect the people of Csettrecsran,” Candentia said quietly.
	</p>
	<p>“Does that not include the people of the north?” Jashi gave a cold snort as she strode over. Henitah tried to stop her sister.
	</p>
	<p>“Do the innocent people of the North mean nothing to you?” The violet eyes glinted dangerously.
	</p>
	<p>“Your land summoned a demon in the first place,” Candentia stated, tone also cold, “and that put the whole planet in grave danger. The king of our land back then didn’t have that much of a choice. It was the only way to save the other lands.”
	</p>
	<p>“Oh, how noble of you. Acting as the savior for the other lands,” Jashi drawled with disgust in her voice.
	</p>
	<p>“And also,” she continued, “that was our grandfather’s doing, which was almost two generations ago. And had nothing to do with the people or the current Hellebore throne. Do you know how much our people have suffered from being trapped in the boundary spell? Do you think we enjoy being in this state? Do you think we didn’t try to eliminate the demon after our grandfather’s death?” 
	</p>
	<p>“Jashi,” Lansher warned, “these walls have ears.”
	</p>
	<p>“Your land turned a blind eye and left us to rot in this hell,” Jashi lowered her voice, but her tone was fierce, “so much for being protectors of the planet.”
	</p>
	<p>“If you needed help, you should’ve just asked,” Candentia hissed, “there are plenty of ways for you to seek our assistant.”
	</p>
	<p>“If you kept track of the records, you should know that we did,” said Lansher suddenly, “our father sent out envoys to your land but they never returned.”
	</p>
	<p>At this, Candentia Hyacinth furrowed her eyebrows.
	</p>
	<p>“There weren’t any that I know of,” she said, “do you really think you could fool me just now? I read every record of past diplomatic visits to Land Hyacinthous, and there was not one from the north. Not one.”
	</p>
	<p>Jashi stepped closer. The violet eyes glared into the gray ones.
	</p>
	<p>“So either you are lying,” she gritted her teeth, “or that your parents got rid of our envoys and never recorded it.”
	</p>
	<p>“There are thousands of possibilities of how your men might’ve failed the task to make it to Land Hyacinthous in the first place. Don’t you think it’s imprudent of you to jump to such rash conclusions?” 
	</p>
	<p>“They were well trained enchanters,” Henitah said softly, peeking out over Jashi’s shoulders. She had the same violet eyes as her twin, though they held a much gentler glint.
	</p>
	<p>“We highly doubt that they would fail the trip without the intruding of others.”
	</p>
	<p>“Have you ever considered that it might actually be <i>your father</i> who lied about sending out your envoys?” The Hyacinth heir raised an eyebrow as she glanced from sister to sister. It amazed her of how similar they looked, but their polar opposite personalities made it easy to tell them apart.
	</p>
	<p>“Are you sure that he didn’t get rid of them himself? After all, he is said to have the same greed as your grandfather—”
	</p>
	<p>Her sentence was cut with a sharp slap from across the cheek.
	</p>
	<p>“Jashi!” Henitah cried softly as she pulled her sister back. She hurried to examine the foreign prisoner, who had several streaks of blood running down the side of her face.
	</p>
	<p>“Don’t you dare touch me,” Candentia hissed and Henitah backed away. “I was only—” her small voice trailed off.
	</p>
	<p>“You seem to have forgotten where you are at the moment, dear cousin,” Jashi said, adjusting her rings. “That was just a small reminder.”
	</p>
	<p>Candentia blinked away the tears that came with the stinging stimulation of her left cheek.
	</p>
	<p>“Violence— yes, that reminds me,” she managed to say, “yet another reason why we cannot let the boundary spell be lifted—”
	</p>
	<p>The sudden taste of blood spread in her mouth as she got hit with another blow. Henitah winched at the sound.
	</p>
	<p>“You Hyacinths just love judging people on your high horses, don’t you?” Jashi said, looking down at the Hyacinth, who hissed back at her with slanting eyes.
	</p>
	<p>“That’s enough, Jashi,” Henitah said, trying to pull back the other, but in vain.
	</p>
	<p>“Say one word again and you’ll pay with your life.”
	</p>
	<p>“Yeah? Well, aren’t you supposed to keep me alive?” 
	</p>
	<p>“That’s true,” Jashi Hellebore grabbed Candentia by the throat and tightened her grip, where black smoke swirled out and snaked around the bare neck of the gray-eyed girl. “But I won’t hesitate to hurt you,” Jashi snarled.
	</p>
	<p>“Jashi—” Henitah sounded alarmed, “careful. Father said to keep her whole before further instructions.”
	</p>
	<p>The black smoke cleared out as Jashi gave an annoyed huff. “Fine.” She pushed the Hyacinth hard before turning away. The chains clattered as they swayed back and forth from the ceiling. “Let’s get Lansher out of here before the lord changes his mind.”
	</p>
	<p class="p">Candentia was awakened by the sound of keys turning above her as she shot her eyes open. She must’ve drifted off in spite of the pain.
	</p>
	<p>A glimpse of violet flashed in front of her eyes before she collapsed to the floor.
	</p>
	<p>“I’m sorry, i’m sorry,” a soft hand reached over to help her up.
	</p>
	<p>Candentia breathed hard. Her arms were numb and limp as she tried to hold her balance.
	</p>
	<p>“Candentia. Can I call you Candentia?”
	</p>
	<p>“You are Henitah Hellebore,” Candentia said weakly.
	</p>
	<p>“Yes,” the girl gave her a tiny smile, “Jashi has another mission today, so I’m here. Sorry for startling you, but you are to move to another cell with Lansher for further instructions.”
	</p>
	<p>“Lansher?” Candentia Hyacinth was puzzled, wasn’t the Hellebore boy taken out of the dungeon? 
	</p>
	<p>“Why is your own brother locked up? Is his punishment not done yet?”
	</p>
	<p>“No, I’m afraid not.” Henitah’s voice was trembling, as well as her body.
	</p>
	<p>“I can’t fathom how he should have to undergo such drastic punishments. He is the prince of Hellebore after all.”
	</p>
	<p>“That’s just the way it is in the north.”
	</p>
	<p>It was the first time Candentia caught a glimpse of what the north looked like, as she staggered aside of Henitah through the castle halls. Two grave guards strode behind them. Dark green vines covered the gray stone walls and crept over the canopy of the gardens, creating dark shadows over the grass covered ground. Candentia shivered slightly— although it was summer, an evident chill shrouded the place. Henitah seemed to hasten her footsteps as she led the small party past an abandoned fountain. In the middle of the stand, and under the tangle of vines and twigs, stood a sculpture of a lonely fairy spreading its wings. Candentia couldn’t help but notice how one of its wings was broken and the hollow eyes seemed to follow them as they went through the messy garden. An unsettling feeling of being watched by someone churned her stomach— someone, or something, was definitely lurking behind the shadows of the tall bushes as they passed.
	</p>
	<p>“What’s—”
	</p>
	<p>“Don’t look. Don’t point,” Henitah held down Candentia’s hands with a hard tug of the chains. “Forgive me,” she whispered to Candentia, who had winced slightly in pain. 
	</p>
	<p>It was not only Henitah that behaved as if someone dangerous was watching them— both of the guards seemed tense and uneasy. Candentia tried to shake off the disturbing feeling that ran down her spine as she tried to keep up with Henitah, her weak legs trembling with every step. Her instinct told her that it would be in vain if she tried to break free, for with the cuffs around her wrists suppressing her powers, she wouldn’t stand a chance against the guards, nor the chilling and strong power she felt of whatever that resided the castle. They soon arrived at the edge of an open space that overlooked a deep amphitheater-like structure. It was a grave and serious-looking place, with numerous guards standing on each level, overwatching every movement of the prison.
	</p>
	<p>“This is it,” Henitah said, her voice quivered and she took a deep breath. The two guards escorted them to the bottom of the steps and followed as two other guards in dark gray uniforms, keys dangling to the side of their belts, led Henitah and Candentia into the cold darkness of the prison. The small lantern in the Hellebore girl’s hand swayed, casting wavering shadows that blended into the deep, dark, corridors. With the chains in the hands of another, Candentia followed obediently, staggering. The ends of the small hairs behind her neck stood up as she glanced around, trying to analyze her surroundings, however, the darkness made it almost impossible. Howls and moans came in from all corners as they climbed up some winding stairs and through some thin, never-ending corridors. The uncanny, beast-like sounds bounced off the tall stone walls and wooshed past the six people, and into the pitch black before them.
	</p>
	<p>It was as if they were to walk on forever, and everytime Candentia felt her trembling legs start to give out under her, the guards would pull her up from under her arms and push her forwards. And just as Candentia was about to pass out from exhaustion, Henitah Hellebore stopped beside her. Candentia looked up and realized that they had arrived at the end of the long hallway, before a turn that led to the left. With a turn of the large key and a murmur of a spell, the clinking of multiple locks opening sounded, and the tall, heavy door of the stone cell was pushed open.
	</p>
	<p>“In,” one of the guards in dark gray said.
	</p>
	<p>Candentia took a step back and breathed out with reluctancy.
	</p>
	<p>“In,” he said again, this time grabbing her by the arm and shoving her through the door.
	</p>
	<p>The chains slipped out of Henitah’s grip with the sudden jerk and Candentia flew over the steps and into the shallow pit of the turret. Her shoulder hit the floor as she went crashing down. Henitah pushed past the guards and rushed to her side. 
	</p>
	<p>“Are you alright?” she asked frantically.
	</p>
	<p>“Why do you care?” Candentia gave a small laugh as she lay limply on the cold stone floor. “You are locking me up, after all,” she eyed the other, who had knelt down beside her. The soft strands of burgundy curls gently brushed the side of Candentia’s numb cheeks as Henitah Hellebore towered over and untangled the long chains. 
	</p>
	<p>“Keys,” Henitah beckoned at the guards.
	</p>
	<p>“Yes ma’am,” a guard, the short one that had pushed Candentia in, handed over two small silver keys to the Hellebore heir with politeness. Henitah removed the heavy chains that were attached to the shackles around Candentia’s hands and feet. 
	</p>
	<p>“The cuffs,” Candentia smiled despite her situation, “no?”
	</p>
	<p>“I’m afraid those will have to stay on,” Henitah gave her an apologetic smile.
	</p>
	<p>“What about me?” a low but sweet voice sounded from the other side of the cell. “Free me from these cuffs, can you, Benjic? They are rather uncomfortable.” 
	</p>
	<p>“My apologies to you, Lord Lansher,” the short guard, Benjic, said with a slight bow, “it’s the King’s, as well as the Lord’s, direct orders.”
	</p>
	<p> “Lady Henitah,” Benjic, the guard, started, “it is time we head back—”
	</p>
	<p>“Am I not allowed to see my own brother for even just one minute? Or is that the Lord’s direct orders as well?” Henitah said coldly. She had slipped over to where Lansher Hellebore sat and was checking in silence to inspect his injuries. She frowned, there were some fresh cuts since the last time she came to see him.
	</p>
	<p>“Your father and the Lord—” Benjic started again,
	</p>
	<p>“I don’t care what they say!” Henitah cried out.
	</p>
	<p>The other guards sucked in sharp breaths as their hands reached for the bats hanging from their belt simultaneously. Benjic, with a shake of his head, signaled for them to stay put.
	</p>
	<p>“It’s alright,” Lansher whispered as he gave his sister a soft kiss on the back of her hand. “I’ll be alright. Don’t you worry.”
	</p>
	<p>“But—” Henitah clasped her fingers tightly around his hands, her violet eyes gazing at him tearfully in the dim light. Lansher squeezed her hand reassuringly before pushing her gently away.
	</p>
	<p>“I turned out just fine the last time, remember?” 
	</p>
	<p>Henitah frowned— the last time her brother got locked away in the cell, his range of his powers somehow shifted, and he went into full rage after the release, killing several prison guards in the process.
	</p>
	<p>“You know how Father and the Lord are,” Lansher said gently, all the while glaring at the guards warningly. “They just have to see that I have learned my lesson this time. And I’ll be back in the castle before you know it.” His voice was low and comforting. 
	</p>
	<p class="pend">“I’ll see you in no time.” 
	</p>
