	<h2 class="chapter title">Reunited </h2>

<div class="chaptercontent">
	<p><b class="b">W</b>ith a sudden motion, Aurelius pretended to trip over a branch, flinging himself sideways behind a tree, and hauled himself toward the steep cleft beside the trail. The ravine could offer him an alternative way up the hills, with the winding passage an ideal cover. He slid down to the bottom and darted up, climbing over the rocks and squeezing through the cracks.
	</p>
	<p>As soon as he found a spot wide enough to climb out of the narrow valley, he scrambled up as silently as he could, and climbed sideways downhill to make his tracks a trap for the person to follow. He stopped just behind a large stone that could hide his own figure, tossed his baggage aside, and adjusted his posture for a clearer view. 
	</p>
	<p>He held his breath as his hands slowly pulled the daggers from their sheaths, and waited. He was certain that the unknown person was in the ravine as well, for he had heard the sound of a block of snow falling when they slid down the way Aurelius did. 
	</p>
	<p>From the place Aurelius was perched at, he caught a sudden glimpse of the incoming shadow, and could tell that it was no ordinary person, for their footsteps were almost silent as snowflakes falling. A thick brown cloak, with the large hood up, hid most of their face, making it hard for Aurelius to identify their gender or ethnicity.
	</p>
	<p>As the other gradually approached, Aurelius could tell that they travelled alone. He twirled the daggers in his hands, and prepared to strike— it was good news that he only had to deal with one opponent. 
	</p>
	<p>As soon as the person stepped into the relatively wide spot of the ravine, they immediately spun around, detecting Aurelius’ presence. But before they could react, Aurelius had already slid down the steep side of the alley, and leapt at them.
	</p>
	<p>The person grunted in pain as their back came in hard contact with the other steep side of the narrow valley. With one hand, Aurelius held one of his blades to the person’s throat, the other arm pressing hard on the person’s chest, while both of his elbows pushed down on the upper arms of the other, holding his opponent in place. The hood of the other still hid their face, but from the body structure, Aurelius assumed that this was a man about the same height as he.
	</p>
	<p>A large chunk of snow fell from above due to the impact, and plopped on the stones, sending dozens of freezing bits their way. 
	</p>
	<p>Aurelius stood his ground, and kept the blade close to the other’s throat, despite the balls of snow showering on them. 
	</p>
	<p>He glared through the damp strands of his hair and growled in a low voice, “hello there, little stalker. Care to tell me who you are? And your reasons for following me?”
	</p>
	<p>The other sucked in a staggered breath, as Aurelius pressed his arm harder on the chest, warning him not to move.
	</p>
	<p>“Aurie,” the other rasped his nickname, and Aurelius froze, for it was the voice he recognized far too well. 
	</p>
	<p>He stared at the lower face from under the hood. The sharp curve of the chin and the shape of the full lips also matched the description in his mind.
	</p>
	<p>It shouldn’t be possible, yet here he was. 
	</p>
	<p>But then again— anything could have happened.
	</p>
	<p>He didn’t let down his guard, nonetheless— anything could happen.
	</p>
	<p>Without releasing the pressure or removing the blade, Aurelius called the name.
	</p>
	<p><i>“Tsahn?”</i>
	</p>
	<p class="p">“Yes, it’s me,” the young man choked out from under the hood. “Aurie, let go of me.”
	</p>
	<p>Aurelius only held tighter to the blade. “Prove it,” he hissed.
	</p>
	<p>He knew better than to throw his trust out blindly. 
	</p>
	<p>“Don’t you recognize me?” the person breathed.
	</p>
	<p>“Well, you could be impersonating him.”
	</p>
	<p>“And why would anyone do that?”
	</p>
	<p>“Stop stalling and prove it! I’m not believing you until you do.”
	</p>
	<p>“How?”
	</p>
	<p>Aurelius thought for a second. “Tell me something only “Tsahn Aouthyerhl” would know about me.”
	</p>
	<p>“You never did change,” the person replied, “fine. You left a letter saying that you are sailing out.”
	</p>
	<p>“Anyone could’ve read the letter if Tsahn showed it to them.”
	</p>
	<p>“I didn’t show it to anyone! I swear.”
	</p>
	<p>“Not enough,” Aurelius said coldly.
	</p>
	<p>He was <i>not</i> going to die from <i>naivety.</i> If it really is his friend Tsahn, why would he follow behind him like a shadow, and not just come up to greet him?
	</p>
	<p>“Fine,” the other huffed, “you left the letter in the coloring book that I had in my drawer, because you know that whenever I have nightmares, I would flip through the pages to calm myself down.”
	</p>
	<p>“That’s…” Aurelius started. That’s fair, he wanted to say.
	</p>
	<p>“Not enough?” the other cut in, their voice beginning to sound angry. “How about this? Your name is Aurelius, but you let me and Candenty call you Aurie. Your favorite color is blue, and not the dark kind nor the bright ones, but a soft blue that glows like the snow reflecting the clear sky.”
	</p>
	<p>Aurelius loosened his grip and turned away the blade. Tshan didn’t stop, however, and kept on rambling in a fierce tone.
	</p>
	<p>“Your favorite season is mostly the winter, because you like the snow, although you hate the cold. Your favorite flavor is the combination of coffee and chestnuts. Your favorite animal is Toviks, and you hate snakes, especially the ones with large fangs. You love to sing, but you seldom do it in front of people. You love reading. You love training. You enjoy all spices, but you can’t handle red peppers. You like flowers, because of the scent, and not the colors.”
	</p>
	<p>“Tshan,” Aurelius said as he let go of his friend. 
	</p>
	<p>“And there’s terrible scars on your back, which is my fault. And there is another one on the lateral side of your left palm, which Candenty and I both have one in the same place,” Tsahn tore off his glove and showed the scar.
	</p>
	<p>He was boiling mad. Aurelius should have been able to recognize him in any other way, but instead, he had to pull this “interrogation.” If it was the other way around, Tsahn was certain that he could recognize the other just by the way Aurelius blinked his eyes.
	</p>
	<p>“Tsahn,” Aurelius repeated, “it’s alright now. That’s enough for me.”  
	</p>
	<p>“Very much obliged,” Tsahn said through gritted teeth. 
	</p>
	<p>He stood up straight, finally able to take the hood off. The hazel eyes glared at Aurelius through the honey brown fluffs of hair. “And <i>now</i> do you believe that I am <i>me</i>?” Tshan hissed.
	</p>
	<p><i>Yup</i>, it certainly was Tsahn.
	</p>
	<p>“You had me at the coloring book,” Aurelius said softly, “I don’t think the Nix is easy to break into. If you were the one that found where the letter was hidden, you should be Tsahn.”
	</p>
	<p>“And you kept holding that goddamn dagger to my throat,” Tsahn said, red faced. 
	</p>
	<p>“I moved it away midway through your thorough introduction of me,” Aurelius chuckled. He climbed up to collect his things, and headed back to the previous trail.
	</p>
	<p>“How should I know?” Tsahn muttered, and followed after Aurelius. “The goddamn hood was covering my sight.”
	</p>
	<p>“By the way, about the scars,” Aurelius said as he climbed slowly up the path, with Tsahn following behind. “It was never your fault. If I were to go back in time, while knowing the outcome, I would still do the same, and so would she.”
	</p>
	<p class="p">They didn’t continue far and decided to set up camp, for the sun was starting to drop quickly. 
	</p>
	<p>While Tsahn made a fire in the snow, Aurelius made a low, sturdy tent out of some branches he had cut off, and some cloth he had acquired throughout his travels. These precious pieces were all from different clans, and were either gifted or traded to him, of which he kept and taken with care. 
	</p>
	<p>The extraordinary thing about the cloths, was that although they were all woven by different types of people, from different materials, in different sizes, they all had the similar characteristic of being extremely light and small, when folded in the right way. 
	</p>
	<p>“There must be some type of magic woven into the fabrics,” Aurelius had said when he showed Tsahn his “souvenirs.”
	</p>
	<p>Tsahn, returning the salute, showed Aurelius the funny looking box he had brought from Annyo. Aurelius watched in astonishment when the small box opened to be five times larger than its regular size. And continued to gap in amazement as Tsahn pulled out some bread, cloaks, and some darts, arrows, knives, and daggers from within. 
	</p>
	<p>“Trina Krelnein’s new invention,” Tsahn explained. “One of Aestas’ requests.”
	</p>
	<p>“To sneak things out of the citadel?” Aurelius asked, chuckling.
	</p>
	<p>“You know her,” Tshan replied.
	</p>
	<p>The box still has its limits, however, for the degree it can shrink the size of an object, it makes up in weight. For example, a two-pound sack of clothes could be shrunk to one-five the regular size, and fit perfectly in the box, but the weight would then become ten pounds. Therefore, Tsahn chose only the light and large objects, like his food and clothes, and the things he preferred to hide away from sudden inspection of others, such as the weapons he carried.
	</p>
	<p class="p">With a fire burning beside the tent, it was warm enough to feel their toes and fingers again. 
	</p>
	<p>“Were you going to kill me if I somehow couldn’t persuade you that I am not an impersonator?” Tsahn asked Aurelius suddenly, staring into the flames.
	</p>
	<p>“No,” Aurelius replied in an instance, “I wouldn’t be able to. And besides, I would always recognize you in the end.”
	</p>
	<p>“Pretty words,” Tsahn snorted, <i>“unreliable.”</i>
	</p>
	<p>“You have to forgive me for holding that dagger to your neck,” Aurelius said sheepishly. “I was spooked by your shadow. I am sorry.”
	</p>
	<p>“You should be. And apart from an apology, you owe me an explanation.”
	</p>
	<p>“I guess I do,” Aurelius said, and rested his cheek on his knees. “Your description of me was frighteningly on point, but you left out something.”
	</p>
	<p>Tsahn perked up his ears. How could there be anything that he missed?
	</p>
	<p>“Do you happen to remember that I once told you before, of what I fear the most?” Aurelius asked.
	</p>
	<p>“To lose someone you love?” 
	</p>
	<p>It was almost an instant reply from Tsahn.
	</p>
	<p>“That’s the first,” Aurelius nodded, “do you know the second?”
	</p>
	<p>And Tsahn remembered.
	</p>
	<p>“... lurking shadows…the possibility of being stabbed in the back…” he murmured. That explains Aurelius’ intense reaction of an unknown follower in the woods.
	</p>
	<p>“I’m sorry.” 
	</p>
	<p>It was Tsahn’s turn to apologize. “I didn’t mean to scare you,” he said, “I honestly didn’t think you would notice me, and was going to go my own way after arriving at the intersection at the top.”
	</p>
	<p>“Then why <i>did</i> you chase after me into the ravine?”
	</p>
	<p>“I thought you were hurt, or captured, something like that. You did fall down all of a sudden, you know? And there’s literally nothing that could’ve made you trip over.”
	</p>
	<p>Tsahn explained to Aurelius that he would be headed east, in the opposite direction of him, and that it was not his intention to run into Aurelius, feeling that it would be an interruption to their respective missions.
	</p>
	<p>He <i>had</i> set out towards Syarchia in the hopes of seeing Aurelius again, but had swerved around before he entered the territory of his homeland. If Aurelius was assigned to the region, it would only raise unwanted suspicion if he arrived, alone, just after a few days.
	</p>
	<p>When he <i>did</i> catch a glimpse of Aurelius far ahead of him in the woods, he had to pinch himself to be sure that it wasn’t an illusion.
	</p>
	<p>He had then been following Aurelius with some distance, deciding whether to meet up with the other. The sensible voice in his mind warned him of the possible dilemma he would have to go through if he did— should he suggest they travel together? But Aurelius might find it bothersome. And besides, Esen Ventus never really did specify whether or not it is allowed. 
	</p>
	<p>Tsahn had concluded with reason, that it was best they part ways without any interaction.
	</p>
	<p class="p">It started snowing again the following day, and Tsahn and Aurelius waited until it was bright to continue the hike. 
	</p>
	<p>“I heard of your possible engagement to the heir of Hyacinth,” Aurelius said after a while. 
	</p>
	<p>Tsahn jerked his head up, stunned. No official announcement has been made, but he supposes that news does travel fast.
	</p>
	<p>“I stayed with your people for a few days,” Aurelius explained, as if he had a pair of eyes glued to his back, “your parents told me then.”
	</p>
	<p>“You were right,” Tsahn said quietly, glancing back down, focusing on the tracks. “Even with <i>her</i> gone, I am still the Syarchia prince. And has to social climb the way. That will never change.”
	</p>
	<p>“Is that why you left the citadel?”
	</p>
	<p>“As a matter of fact, yes. It was the last straw on the camel’s back.”
	</p>
	<p>“Is the little lady of Hyacinth alright with you leaving?”
	</p>
	<p>“Well,” Tsahn replied, panting, “Aestas considered the pros and cons, and decided that it was better if I decide on my own fate.”
	</p>
	<p>“She gave you a choice,” Aurelius said, rather surprised.
	</p>
	<p>“She did.”
	</p>
	<p>“That’s mature of her.”
	</p>
	<p>Tsahn smiled. “She has grown to be more sensible than a lot of adults nowadays.”
	</p>
	<p class="p">Aestas Hyacinth had run all over the citadel one day in autumn, trying to find Tsahn, after attending another afternoon meeting. 
	</p>
	<p>Contrary to the R.A. meetings she had grown used to, that particular one was with several diplomatic officials of the citadel, and two southerners— people from clan Syarchia.
	</p>
	<p>Tsahn remembered how his stomach had dropped when Aestas told him that two Syarchians were at the citadel, discussing further measures of their political alliance.
	</p>
	<p>It was soon suggested that Aestas Hyacinth replace her lost sister in the contract, and become the betrothed of Tsahn Aouthyerhl. Both of them didn’t dare oppose, although deep down they knew they simply could not let it happen. 
	</p>
	<p>From Aestas’ point of view, as much as she loved Tsahn Aouthyerhl, her feelings towards him were more of a sibling type of love. Even if she were to become romantically attracted to the older, which wasn’t impossible if she were to be honest, she knew deep down that she would never be satisfied, feeling as if she were again, a substitute for her older sister. 
	</p>
	<p>Regardless of the puppy crush she had for the gentle young lad when she had been younger, she felt like she <i>had</i> to prevent the engagement from happening. It was to spare herself from further suffering. It was the present and future she should be taking care of.
	</p>
	<p>But there was also a longing for Tsahn Aouthyerhl to stay forever by her side, which led to her thinking that if he were to agree to the proposal, she might want it to happen.
	</p>
	<p>Torn, she had turned to Esen Ventus, Fae Baykartte, and Trina Krelnein for advice. 
	</p>
	<p>Upon the contradictions, Trina voted for Aestas to listen to her heart, and if she wanted Tsahn to stay, she should tell him and see what he had got to say. 
	</p>
	<p>As for the two lieutenants, they suggested that if Aestas needed to think, it would buy some time if Tsahn Aouthyerhl joined in the secret operation, and sail out in the name of special training. It would be an honorable position for him, a direct apprentice of a R.A. official, which clan Syarchia surely wouldn’t refuse. 
	</p>
	<p>And there were a few of Fae Baykartte’s words that formed the shape of Aestas’ final decision—
	</p>
	<p>“If you asked Tsahn to stay,” Fae said, “given my understanding of his personality— even if it meant that he might be feeling trapped forever, he wouldn’t speak it, in fear of hurting you. If you asked him to stay— he would, without a doubt.”
	</p>
	<p>And Aestas knew, deep down, that she was right. Therefore, after days of contemplating, she finally approached Tsahn and told him the details of the recent events, and the new proposal of him becoming Fae Baykartte’s direct apprentice.
	</p>
	<p>She had conveyed <i>only</i> her opposition to the idea of them getting engaged, and explained how she didn’t wish for both of their wings being clipped forever. She also told him that whether he were to sail out or stay, the decision was his, and whatever he decided, she would respect it.
	</p>
	<p>As for Tsahn, the fact that Aestas had a group of trustworthy young and upcoming officials of the R.A. looking out for her, soothed most of his worries. He also made Aestas promise him that if she ever needed him back at the citadel, she would send out a code that only they both could decipher in the papers, in order that he receive the message without anyone ever discovering. And he told her that if he ever did receive her call for help, he would fly back to Annyo instantly even if he were to be on the other side of the globe.
	</p>
	<p> After making sure that everything was in place, he gladly accepted the re-invite to join the mission, and left on a foggy winter morning before the dawning of another day.
	</p>
	<p>The sail to the southern lands was not as smooth as Tsahn preferred it to be, for the winter gale was strong at sea, and unpredictable storms raged. He never liked the feeling of sailing over vast oceans in fear of a shipwreck and the possibilities of drowning. Nevertheless, the ship he had been traveling on made it to shore eventually.
	</p>
	<p>As soon as he set foot on land, he headed straight in the direction of the highlands of clan Fyoun. Tsahn would never tell, but just before his departure, Esen Ventus had told him to head for clan Fyoun with a grin. It would be breaking the rules to reveal any locations of his agents, but Esen had dropped the hint for Tsahn to catch, nonetheless.
	</p>
	<p class="p">Contrary to Aurelius, who traveled through the grasslands and a desert on horseback, heading in a straight line, Tsahn swerved east, after he finished crossing the grasslands, and headed towards the rolling hills of Orine. The forest and small mountains were closer to his preference. And with the help of Trina Krelnein’s magical box, tucked away in the pouch on his belt, he could make use of his Syarchian advantage— using the tall trees as shelter, and steep cliffs as push-off spots, Tsahn Aouthyerhl had travelled through air, with his Syarchian cloak wrapped around his shoulders, and strapped around his wrists.
	</p>
	<p>The cloak was Aestas’ farewell present to him. She had persuaded the king and queen to grant special permission for the locked-up cloak to be back in Tsahn’s possession during his time in “training” overseas. It was a saviour, for with the cloak, Tsahn had reached Fyoun within fourteen days. If he were to travel on foot through the thick snow, who knows where he would end up, let alone stay alive.
	</p>
	<p>Much to Tsahn’s dismay, the people of clan Fyoun were extremely hostile towards him, for they recognized his Syarchian cloak. His yellow hazel eyes that resembled the hawk, giving away his Syarchian heritage, only added fuel to Clan Fyoun’s detest. Syarchian’s were viewed as their enemy, after all.
	</p>
	<p>He made the attempt to tell them that he came in peace, and meant no harm, but being one of the predator clans for Fyoun, he guessed that their reactions towards his unannounced appearance was reasonable.
	</p>
	<p>Within the clamor, an old woman came walking slowly towards Tsahn. The crowd parted the way for her, and he noticed a young teenage girl peering at him with bright brown eyes on the side. 
	</p>
	<p>“They’re the same,” the girl blurted out and ran up past the old woman, right up to Tsahn.
	</p>
	<p>“Artties! Back down,” some adults in the crowd had bleated out, worried that the girl might get hurt. But the girl named Artties only stepped nearer to the Syarchian, and pointed to his earrings.
	</p>
	<p>“That small stone,” she said, pointing to the triangular gray gem on Tsahn’s right upper lobe, “it’s the same as Aurelius’”
	</p>
	<p>At this, Tsahn’s heart soared.
	</p>
	<p>“Is he here?” he asked. “He is my friend, and I am looking for him.”
	</p>
	<p>The girl shook her head. “He left four days ago.”
	</p>
	<p>The old woman finally reached them and she beckoned for Tsahn’s ear. “I can tell you are a kind boy,” she rasped, “but you are Syarchian, and Syarchians can not stay at Fyoun. Maybe one day it will be different, but you have to leave before my people hurt you.” 
	</p>
	<p>She slipped a dried flower into Tsahn’s cloak.
	</p>
	<p>“Take this with you,” she said, as she gave him a bright smile through her wrinkles. “For good luck.”
	</p>
	<p>And as Tsahn thanked her with a bow, she told him in another whisper. “The boy from the land of all origins, your friend you say, he headed south, towards your homeland Syarchia. ”
	</p><br>
	<p class="p">Tshan’s forehead bumped into the bottom of Aurelius’ baggage accidentally, when the lad had suddenly stopped, in search of the path. 
	</p>
	<p>Tsahn glanced around and saw a bright blue ribbon tied on the branches a few meters ahead. 
	</p>
	<p>“There,” he said, pointing.
	</p>
	<p>The small cliff ahead seemed to be a newly formed obstacle that blocked their way back to the path. There was a rather large gap to the top, which Aurelius climbed up with ease. He turned back and held out a hand to Tsahn.
	</p>
	<p>“Careful,” he said, “it’s slippery.”
	</p>
	<p>Tsahn grabbed the branches instead, refusing his companion’s help, and started hoisting himself up. The ground, to his surprise, was far more slippery than he had imagined. He let out a small yelp as his legs slipped out under. Just as Tsahn thought he was going to fall, a strong grip pulled him up, and he landed safely on a small flat platform.
	</p>
	<p>“I told you,” Aurelius’ voice rumbled deep in his ear, “it’s slippery.”
	</p>
	<p>Tsahn felt his ears grow hot and stumbled back, only for Aurelius to hold on to him even tighter.
	</p>
	<p>“Do you have a death wish?” Aurelius hissed, “stop squirming, and hold on to something before you fall.”
	</p>
	<p>Tsahn did as he was told. Although he mumbled angrily that it was Aurelius’ fault to make the climb look effortless, which misguided his judgment.
	</p>
	<p>“Such Cadi behavior,” Aurelius grumbled as he turned back to the path.
	</p>
	<p>Tsahn’s heart skipped a beat. 
	</p>
	<p>“Her name,” he exclaimed, “you are finally saying her name.”
	</p>
	<p>How bizarre it was, that it was at this moment, that the name Aurelius had not been able to say for a long time, rolled off of his tongue without him even realizing.
	</p>
	<p>“Cadi,” Aurelius said again in a whisper, realizing it was in fact, the first time he had been able to speak the name without the gut-wrenching feeling.
	</p>
	<p>“Cadi, Cadi, Cadi.”
	</p>
	<p>Behind him, Tsahn secretly brushed his eyes with his gloves, and smiled.
	</p>
	<p>After another two hours of climbing, they arrived at the top of the mountain, where multiple paths meet. At the intersection, Aurelius turned right without hesitation, to the road that led down to the west of the mountains. 
	</p>
	<p>Tsahn, however, stopped.
	</p>
	<p>“So…” Aurelius said, as he adjusted his bag, “I will be heading west, and you east. I guess this is where we part again.”
	</p>
	<p><i>Stay for a minute</i>, Tsahn wanted to say, but kept silent, for he knew it would change nothing. 
	</p>
	<p>“Farewell, Tsahn,” Aurelius said softly when Tsahn remained quiet. “Take care.” And after one last look at his childhood friend, Aurelius turned away.
	</p>
	<p>Tsahn gazed after Aurelius’ back, his sight blurring up. 
	</p>
	<p><i>“Shit. It must be because of the cold,”</i> he thought.
	</p>
	<p>It was a miracle, being able to run into Aurelius in the vast lands. Regret, however, started to fill Tsahn’s mind as he stood there, unable to make a final decision. 
	</p>
	<p>“What was I thinking?” Tsahn thought to himself, as he watched Aurelius’ figure become blurrier and blurrier. He had barged to Clan Fyuon without thinking twice, and followed after his instincts, which eventually led him to Aurelius. However, after really seeing his friend in person again, he lost all senses of which direction he should be headed. 
	</p>
	<p>There was a fleeting thought that he could tag behind Aurelius. No rules said that they couldn’t be travelling in groups or pairs, after all. And as long as they stayed hidden and worked discreetly… Tsahn thought that there was indeed no harm in teaming up with Aurelius. 
	</p>
	<p>In fact, the desire to stay with the raven haired lad <i>burned</i>, but flashbacks of the cold gaze of the amber eyes discouraged him from following after his direction.
	</p>
	<p>Aurelius glanced over his shoulder and stopped, when he realized that Tsahn still stood frozen at the intersection.
	</p>
	<p>“Tsahn?” he called back, “are you alright?” 
	</p>
	<p>The other made no response.
	</p>
	<p>New snow soon covered the tracks of his footsteps, and a smooth coating of silvery white separated him and the other.
	</p>
	<p>After some contemplation, Aurelius started to climb back. When he was a few steps away from the intersection, he realized that Tsahn was trembling.
	</p>
	<p>Aurelius cursed at himself and ran over.
	</p>
	<p><i>Never be the first one to walk away from Tsahn.</i>
	</p>
	<p>He had forgotten about the vow he and Candentia took when they were just eleven years old.
	</p>
	<p>“Such a terrible friend,” it was as if he could hear her voice, scorning at him.
	</p>
	<p>But on the other hand, wasn’t it Tsahn who wanted them to go their separate ways? 
	</p>
	<p>Nevertheless, he should’ve waited for Tsahn to be the one that walked away first. 
	</p>
	<p>Aurelius clenched his jaw. 
	</p>
	<p>This was going to be the last time he broke the promise he made with Candentia.
	</p>
	<p class="p">“Are you alright?” Aurelius asked again, as he approached the other.
	</p>
	<p>Tsahn nodded as he gave the corner of his right eye a small flick, and took a few steps back. 
	</p>
	<p>“Why did you come back?” he asked, rather astonished to see Aurelius again all of a sudden.
	</p>
	<p>“I realized that I should’ve given you a proper goodbye.”
	</p>
	<p>“Goodbye, then.” 
	</p>
	<p>“Goodbye.” Aurelius waited for Tsahn to turn away.
	</p>
	<p>“What are <i>you</i> waiting for?” Tsahn let out a short laugh. “Off you go.”
	</p>
	<p>“This time, I’ll be the one seeing you off. I feel like I have failed you far too many times.”
	</p>
	<p>Tsahn shook his head and spun Aurelius around, pushing him in the direction of the west path. 
	</p>
	<p>“You go,” he said, “I’m just resting for a bit.”
	</p>
	<p>Aurelius looked over his shoulder and studied the other. He recognized the look— it was the fear of abandonment that flowed through the yellow hazel eyes. 
	</p>
	<p>“Come,” he blurted out suddenly, “come with me.”
	</p>
	<p>Tsahn tightened his grasp on the cloak, but said nothing.
	</p>
	<p>“Do you not want to?” Aurelius asked, puzzled, “I know you said you wanted to head east, but you look as if your mind is telling you otherwise—”
	</p>
	<p>“Is that even allowed?” Tsahn cut in.
	</p>
	<p>“Why wouldn’t it be?” Aurelius said as he tried to turn back around. Tsahn’s firm grasp, however, held him in place.
	</p>
	<p>“Come on,” Aurelius urged, “I’m sure Ventus wouldn’t mind. And even if he did, who cares? We won’t tell him anyway.”
	</p>
	<p>Tsahn hung his head, and Aurelius felt a sudden warmth close up behind him, as a forehead rested gently on his shoulder.
	</p>
	<p>Aurelius sighed. This particular pet hawk was too large in his opinion. Nevertheless, it would be better to have Tsahn in his sight. Who knows whether the southern boy could keep himself alive in these winters. 
	</p>
	<p>Aurelius shuddered at the sudden thought that Candentia’s soul might come after him, or worse, kill him, if she found out that Aurelius had left Tsahn to be on his own. 
	</p>
	<p>He reached back and ruffled the honey brown locks, the same way Cadi would have done. It seemed to have done the trick, for Tsahn released him from the tight hold of the claws.
	</p>
	<p>“And if either one of us does find Cadi,” Aurelius said, as he stepped forward with slight relief, “it would be better if we are united altogether.”
	</p>
	<p>“Am I not a burden?” Tsahn whined softly, his voice almost blown away by the wind.
	</p>
	<p>Aurelius, almost not catching the words, spun around.
	</p>
	<p>“Are you coming or not?” he hissed, his burnt amber eyes staring straight into the soul of the other. You are not, he meant. “And don’t say no.”
	</p>
	<p>At this, Tsahn finally broke into a small grin. He understood his friend well enough to know what he meant.
	</p>
	<p> “What if I do?” he asked slyly, although he strode towards Aurelius rather obediently.
	</p>
	<p>“Oh, I dare you to try. But we both know that you can’t survive without me,” was Aurelius’ rather cheerful answer.
	</p>
	<p>“Wanna bet?” Tsahn said with a soft giggle.
	</p>
	<p>Aurelius smiled. “Gladly,” he replied, the memory of a summer day at the coast of Annyo resurfacing. Somehow, his heart felt the lightest it has been ever since the day Candentia disappeared.
	</p>
	<p>It was to his sudden epiphany, that even though Candentia might not be by their side, she still exists through them. From their memories, to the way they move and the way they talk, the shadow of her somehow had always been there, engraved into their minds. As long as Tsahn and Aurelius remained by each other’s side, they would be reminded, constantly, of what their dearest friend was like.
	</p>
	<p>Perhaps it was one of the reasons for their previous conflicts, as it had been merely too painful to be in the other’s presence. Aurelius thought of Aestas Hyacinth— it could be a way to explain the ambivalence of her strong attachment <i>and</i> resistance towards them.
	</p>
	<p>Regardless of the foregoing contradictions, they all seemed to be headed towards the right direction. 
	</p>
	<p>“Time heals all wounds,” was what Aurelius often heard Candentia say to herself, whenever she was in pain. It could be the problems regarding her parents, or, the passing away of a dear one. Whenever the girl had been torn, she would comfort herself with the words, which she did believe were true. Tsahn held a similar belief as her, but Aurelius, on the other hand, did not. At least, not entirely, for he knew for a fact, that his scars would forever be there. And the small piece of his heart that Candentia had taken away when she disappeared, would always be missing. 
	</p>
	<p>What he could learn to do, was to stop ignoring the pain and act as if it has never been there, and start acknowledging it, and try to find a way to live aside it. Let suffering and happiness coexist, for they are just like the polar sides of the color palette. It would be as if taking black and white, and blending them together. One would obtain the color grey, which, using Candentia’s words— “is the perfect color to ever exist, isn’t it?”
	</p>
	<p class="pend"> Aurelius smiled at the memory of her large doe eyes, and thought to himself, <i>“it is, indeed.”</i>
