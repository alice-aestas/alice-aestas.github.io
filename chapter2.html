<div class="chaptercontent">
	<p><b class="b">A</b>estas Hyacinth lay under the shadows of a large hawthorn tree, one arm over her eyes. The grass gently brushed her cheeks, blown by the soft summer breeze.
	</p>
	<p>She was actually supposed to be in the citadel preparing for the upcoming summer festival. But she had snuck out instead, and ran all the way downhill to the south-west borough of Annyo city to join her friends at the crook in the woods. 
	</p>
	<p>The annual festival, a four-day event, was held to celebrate the start of the summer, and by coincidence, Aestas Hyacinth’s birthday was on the second day. 
	</p>
	<p>There would be a fair, and numerous parades in Annyo, and a large ball held in the citadel, where a celebration of Aestas’ birthday would take place. The long anticipated list of new recruits and newly appointed officials for the royal army would also be announced that day.
	</p>
	<p>Although Aestas normally would’ve looked forward to these types of events, things were different for her this year. It was going to be her sweet sixteen, which meant that she would be officially presented to the whole Csettrecsran as the second heir to the throne of Land Hyacinthous. And to make her even more nervous, it was she, who would be the one presenting the new badges to the new recruits and newly appointed officials at the R.A. announcement ceremony this year.
	</p>
	<p>It felt like the pressure was on the verge of squashing her, and her sister— Candentia Hyacinth, who was in charge of conducting this year’s R.A. announcement ceremony wasn’t of any help to her growing anxiety, if not making it worse.  
	</p>
	<p>An afternoon of playing in the water was all Aestas wanted. Summer was to be enjoyed outdoors, and not trapped inside, suffering, under pressure and responsibilities. 
	</p>
	<p>“Youth is something we should all have the right to experience. It wouldn’t be fair if I was deprived of the chance, would it?” she often said. And, being true to her own heart, she snuck out whenever she could.
