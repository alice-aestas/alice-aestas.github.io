	<div class="chaptercontent">
		<p><b class="b">A</b>estas Hyacinth lay under the shadows of a large hawthorn tree, one arm over her eyes.
			The
			grass gently brushed her cheeks, blown by the soft summer breeze.
		</p>
		<p>She was actually supposed to be in the citadel preparing for the upcoming summer festival. But she had
			snuck
			out instead, and ran all the way downhill to the south-west borough of Annyo city to join her friends at
			the
			crook in the woods.
		</p>
		<p>The annual festival, a four-day event, was held to celebrate the start of the summer, and by coincidence,
			Aestas Hyacinth’s birthday was on the second day.
		</p>
		<p>There would be a fair, and numerous parades in Annyo, and a large ball held in the citadel, where a
			celebration of Aestas’ birthday would take place. The long anticipated list of new recruits and newly
			appointed officials for the royal army would also be announced that day.
		</p>
		<p>Although Aestas normally would’ve looked forward to these types of events, things were different for her
			this
			year. It was going to be her sweet sixteen, which meant that she would be officially presented to the
			whole
			Csettrecsran as the second heir to the throne of Land Hyacinthous. And to make her even more nervous, it
			was
			she, who would be the one presenting the new badges to the new recruits and newly appointed officials at
			the
			R.A. announcement ceremony this year.
		</p>
		<p>It felt like the pressure was on the verge of squashing her, and her sister— Candentia Hyacinth, who was
			in
			charge of conducting this year’s R.A. announcement ceremony wasn’t of any help to her growing anxiety,
			if
			not making it worse.
		</p>
		<p>An afternoon of playing in the water was all Aestas wanted. Summer was to be enjoyed outdoors, and not
			trapped inside, suffering, under pressure and responsibilities.
		</p>
		<p>“Youth is something we should all have the right to experience. It wouldn’t be fair if I was deprived of
			the
			chance, would it?” she often said. And, being true to her own heart, she snuck out whenever she could.
		</p>
		<p>After a whole afternoon of running and splashing about, most of Aestas’ friends had collapsed under the
			tree
			and were taking peaceful naps. Shardow Gier, a boy with caramel-blond-colored hair and forest green
			eyes,
			was the only one awake. He sat on the grass with his back leaning against the trunk of the old hawthorn
			tree, strummed a sweet tune on his fiddle and hummed softly. Beside him, Aestas had fallen into a
			peaceful
			slumber, and was dreaming.
		</p>
		<p class="p">It was a vivid memory she dreamt about, a night where she and her sister, Candentia Hyacinth,
			were
			still little girls, and their mother sat by the bedside, reading a book.
		</p>
		<p>Her mother’s soothing voice in her dream, telling the legend of their origin, made her smile in her
			sleep.
		</p>
		<p class="p">“Although the colors of Csettrecsran changed dramatically over the course of time, it has
			always
			been a planet full of ancient magic,” Queen Merythdian of Land Hyacinthous read, as the eight-year old
			Candentia and the four-year old Aestas listened intently.
		</p>
		<div class="momreadingbook">
			<p class="p">“The planet consists of five different regions, every one of them enchanting in their
				unique
				way, and according to heritage, not only do the people have different cultures and races, but also
				very
				different powers and lifestyles.
			</p>
			<p>On the Southern lands, there are people who gather in clans, living by the powers of different
				animals,
				with more groups than one can imagine. ‘There are clans of wolves, and clans of bear, they howl at
				night, they growl and tear. There are clans of antelope, and clans of deer, when happy, they danced,
				when sad, they shed tears. There are clans of snakes and clans of …,’ and the song goes on and on…
			</p>
			<p>One might wonder, if there’s a gang that rose above the others. Well, dear reader, here’s the answer.
				Yes, there was, and yes, there still is. Amongst the clans of the southern lands, there is this one
				powerful group — the birds of prey. With the eyes of a hawk, and bravery of an eagle, the patrollers
				of
				Clan Syarchia, found a rock made of crystal. The Chief sent it as a present, a gesture of respect,
				to
				the Land Hyacinthous, for enchanters to inspect. After thorough examinations, they were full of
				delight,
				and established diplomatic relations, exchanging power for light. So that’s right. For as they say,
				being closely involved with the throne for decades— Clan Syarchia, is still one of the greatest to
				this
				day.”
			</p>
		</div>
		<p class="p">The queen paused for a moment and turned to Candentia, “it is said that the only child of the
			current chief of the clan Syarchia is actually the same age as you, dear.”
		</p>
		<p>“Is she really?” Candentia blinked, “will I meet her some day?”
		</p>
		<p>“<i>‘He’</i>, I'm afraid,” Queen Merythdian corrected her, “it’s a son that they have. And, yes, when the
			time comes, I suppose that you will get to meet the boy. Promise me you’ll be nice to him, dear.”
		</p>
		<p>Candentia nodded obediently.
		</p>
		<p>“Keep telling the story, mother!” Aestas bounced up and down, “pleeeease,” she begged.
		</p>
		<p>Merythdian smiled and continued to read out loud.
		</p>
		<div class="momreadingbook">
			<p>“And in the Eastern oceans and islands where both mysterious myths and serious education take place,
				there is a mixture of the different tribes and scholars from around the world.
			</p>
			<p>There also is the West, a land adored by merchants and performers, which have always been and always
				will
				be, full of music, life and light. And as the Csettrecsrain saying goes, ‘one mustn’t rest, before
				seeing the West,’ so dear reader, you know what to do. Pack up your bags and sail for the west!”
			</p>
			<p>“And there is the North— ‘The Great North,’ as some would call it. Famous for creating magical toys,
				tools, and weapons, the land has been under the reign of the Hellebore bloodline for five
				generations.
				The abundance of Northern Crystals, which provided the main source of magic power in the modern days
				of
				most cities of Csettrecsran, had made them one of the most powerful lands. The blood relation with
				the
				powerful Hyacinth family had also been a solid foundation to the reign of the Hellebores. However,
				after
				the war broke out, nothing was the same for both families, and in the end, in order to prevent a
				dangerous power outage of destruction, the rulers of Hyacinth made the difficult choice to try
				casting a
				bounding enchantment on the North and eventually succeeded after years of many enchanters weaving
				the
				spell, and ended the seven-year-long war. From then on, all communications were heavily restricted,
				and
				the North was no longer open to other regions on Csettrecsran.
			</p>
			<p>The four regions, all peculiar in their unique way, split the globe fairly and operated with harmony,
				despite their differences and small disputes. And in the center of all regions, there is the land
				that
				is known to be the origin of all magical creatures and powers of Csettrecsran—
			</p>
			<p>Land Hyacinthous, ruled by the family Hyacinth, is the smallest in area, yet the strongest in power.
				They
				are the hinge of all lands and the center of organization. The bloodline of the throne has been
				carried
				on through many and many centuries, as ancient as all tales go. Of all enchanters and sorcerers,
				according to ancient documentaries, the Hyacinth bloodline was said to be the first and greatest
				rulers
				to ever exist. With a unique power, they knew how to extract the magical essence of nature, weather,
				and
				seasons. The other regions, in respect of their powers, trusted them to set up a system of
				coordination
				and relied on their management for the sake of peace and harmony.
			</p>
			<p>It was said in legends, that the land was once vast with nothing but forests and grasslands, and on
				the
				grasslands grew thousands and thousands of flowers. Among these flowers, there was a special kind
				that
				changed their colors every night in order to broadcast the weather to the ancient spirits above.
				Enchanting for the spirits, but rather tiresome for the flowers.
			</p>
			<p>The hyacinth flowers, overtime, grew their own individual preference of seasons, and decided to take
				turns as groups to bloom. Through rain, wind, sunshine and storm; through spring, summer, autumn and
				winter, these little stars on the grassland bloomed with grace and flair. Their method didn’t go
				unnoticed, and soon the Spirit of Season came to the grasslands to inspect the phenomenon.
			</p>
			<p>Amused and impressed, the Spirit of Season asked the hyacinths to teach their methods to all the
				other
				flowers and help with the rotation of season and weather. So every night, when the stars start to
				shine
				in the sky, the hyacinths that weren’t on call that night, would incarnate as butterflies and set
				out to
				deliver instructions to all other flowers in bloom.”
			</p>
		</div>
		<p>“<i>What?</i> So our ancestors weren’t Season Spirits?” Aestas blurted out with four year old bluntness.
		</p>
		<p>“Yeah, I never thought they would be<i> literally</i> hyacinths,” Candentia chimed in.
		</p>
		<p>“What’s a hyacinth like?” Aestas asked.
		</p>
		<p>“A typa flower that looks like little stars on the grasslands,” was Candentia’s answer.
		</p>
		<p>Queen Merythdian smiled at her girls and closed the book. Enough reading for today.
		</p>
		<p>“Well, you could say that they were once flowers, and you could also say that they were once
			butterflies,”
			she said.
		</p>
		<p>“What! Butterflies?!” Aestas was surprised, <i>“we could fly?!!”</i>
		</p>
		<p>“Ouch,” her sister said, being hit by Aestas’ flapping hands. She rubbed her arm.
		</p>
		<p>Their mother chuckled and smoothed both their hairs.
		</p>
		<p>“Yup, you’re right. I guess we<i> did</i> know how to fly,” she shooed Candentia off of Aestas’ bed, held
			the
			child’s hand and walked her back to the one across the room, and tucked her under the covers, “and now
			it’s
			time for you both to go to sleep, and then you can fly in your dreams.”
		</p>
		<p>“I have decided to dream about being a butterfly,” Candentia announced with eight-year-old innocence.
		</p>
		<p>“Me too!” Aestas chimed in, “I want to be a butterfly, too.”
		</p>
		<p>“Let’s quickly go to sleep then” Candentia said, “maybe we can fly together.”
		</p>
		<p>“Yes! Wait for me. I’m going to sleep right now,” Aestas closed her eyes hurriedly.
		</p>
		<p>Merythdian stifled a laugh as she went over to tuck Aestas in. The little girl had squeezed her eyes
			shut,
			trying so hard to fall asleep instantly. But the little one shot her eyes open again when Merythdian
			bent
			down to brush the strands of soft brown hair aside. The covers fell off her shoulders as she sat up. She
			strained her neck to see if her big sister was asleep. The older was laying perfectly still, silky black
			locks spread peacefully across the white satin pillow.
		</p>
		<p>“Wait, Candentia! Don’t fall asleep so fast,” Aestas called desperately, in fear of being left behind,
			“please wait for me.”
		</p>
		<p>Candentia’s dark lashes fluttered open, revealing a pair of gray eyes, “I’m still awake,” she said,
			without
			moving a muscle.
		</p>
		<p>“Now, now,” their mother said, secretly laughing her heart out in her mind, “both of you, lie down
			nicely.”
		</p>
		<p>“<i>I am not even moving,</i>” Candentia said.
		</p>
		<p>Aestas lay down again.
		</p>
		<p>“I’m not moving, too,” she said, “I’m lying down again.”
		</p>
		<p>“Yes, you are,” a different voice laughed as the door of their bedroom opened, “such an angel, are you?”
		</p>
		<p>“Father!” Aestas started to sit up again, but quickly stopped herself, “you’re finally here. I missed you
			so
			much!”
		</p>
		<p>“Aww, I missed you, too, little one” the King ruffled Aestas’ hair and bent down for a goodnight kiss.
		</p>
		<p>“Mother was telling us how we were butterflies once,” Candentia told him when he went over and kissed her
			on
			the forehead.
		</p>
		<p>“Did she, now?” he smiled.
		</p>
		<p>“Yes,” she replied.
		</p>
		<p>He stood there for a second before tucking her in more tightly.
		</p>
		<p>“Good night, sleep tight,” she started.
		</p>
		<p>“Don’t let the frostbite bite,” he replied.
		</p>
		<p>Candentia giggled and snuggled in her covers, happy.
		</p>
		<p>“Are you sleepy, too, Father?” Aestas inquired as she heard his yawn.
		</p>
		<p>“You caught me,” he went back to her bed and hugged his little one, “but a hug from the little princess
			will
			give me energy.”
		</p>
		<p>“But then you’ll be so awake, you can’t fall asleep!” Aestas giggled, “Oh, and I’m going to be a
			butterfly
			like Mother’s story with Candentia in our dreams tonight,” she continued, “and we will fly.”
		</p>
		<p>“That’s wonderful,” he laughed and looked at Merythdian, who held the same amusement as him in her eyes,
			“tell me all about it tomorrow.”
		</p>
		<p>“I will!” came the little one’s happy answer.
		</p>
		<p>“Good night, you two,” their Mother said before gently closing the door, “sweet dreams.”
		</p>
		<p>“Good night!” was Aestas’ sleepy call.
		</p>
		<p>“Good night,” was Candentia’s quiet whisper.
		</p>
		<p>The darkness was still for a moment before a small whisper came from Aestas’ bed.
		</p>
		<p>“Candentia? Can you hear me? Are you asleep?”
		</p>
		<p>“Yes?” her sister whispered back, “what’s the matter?”
		</p>
		<p>“Will you go flying without me if I can’t fall asleep?” Aestas asked in a tiny voice.
		</p>
		<p>She didn’t want her sister to be mad at her if she couldn’t keep up, but she didn’t want to be left
			behind,
			either. This was a dilemma Aestas would go through for a fair amount of time in the future, and her
			response
			to the situation would change from time to time as she grew older, but as she was still a little girl
			here,
			clinging tightly to her older sister was all she knew, and their inseparable bond was as secure as bonds
			could ever be.
		</p>
		<p>“Don’t worry,” came Candentia’s gentle voice, “I’ll wait until you fall asleep before I close my eyes.”
		</p>
		<p>“Can I sleep with you on your bed?” Aestas asked.
		</p>
		<p>Most of the times when Aestas asked, the older would comply. And the times when Candentia refused, the
			girl
			would still come over and pat her little sister’s head until the younger fell asleep. As was that night.
		</p>
		<p>“I’ll come over,” Candentia said.
		</p>
		<p>Aestas could hear her sister slide out of her bed and walk over.
		</p>
		<p>“Did you bring Aurora with you?” Aestas asked.
		</p>
		<p>Aurora was Candentia’s favorite stuffed animal— a gray Tovik, which was gifted to her on her second
			birthday
			by Erai Solicas and his wife, both close friends of the king and queen.
		</p>
		<p>“Yes, I did.” Candentia handed the fluffy thing over as she climbed onto the bed, grunting slightly, “you
			can
			hug her till you fall asleep.”
		</p>
		<p>The long pointy ears and fluffy, fox-like tail made Aestas beam with delight. She snuggled against the
			soft
			fur of the stuffed animal and smiled with content.
		</p>
		<p>“Close your eyes and lay still,” her sister said, gently patting her younger sister on the head, “I’ll
			sing
			to you till you fall asleep.”
		</p>
		<p>Drowsy and tired, Aestas did as she was told. Against the slow rhythm of the fingers running through her
			hair, she gradually drifted off as her sister’s low humming became further and further away. And before
			the
			song ended, Aestas was already fast asleep, dreaming— a dream where she was a butterfly, dancing to a
			sweet,
			sweet melody that reminded her of honey and the summer breeze.
		</p><br>
		<p class="p">“Aestas,” someone called her, “Aestas, wake up!”
		</p>
		<p>Aestas rubbed her eyes and sat up. It was Shardow Gier that shook her awake, his forest green eyes
			peering
			down at her from under his caramel blond fluffs of hair. She looked around and noticed that the
			elongated
			shadows of the trees had grown much longer.
		</p>
		<p>“<i>Shit</i>, what time is it?” she asked, lime-colored eyes still drowsy.
		</p>
		<p>“The sun’s not down yet,” Shardow said.
		</p>
		<p>“Well, duh,” Aestas rolled her eyes and pointed from the sun and to her eyes. She meant that she could
			see
			just fine.
		</p>
		<p>Shardow Gier laughed heartily and sprang up. He dusted off his pants before offering his hands to Aestas.
			She
			reached out and grabbed both his hands.
		</p>
		<p>“It’s time to head home, though,” he grunted as he pulled Aestas to her feet, “I have to get home before
			supper is served. Let’s wake those four sleepy bears up,” he said, nodding his head at the others that
			were
			still sleeping soundly on the grass.
		</p>
		<p class="p">
		</p>
		<p>The late afternoon sky was clear as Aestas, Shardow, and their group of friends ran out of the woods and
			into
			the alleys of Annyo city.
		</p>
		<p>The group of teenagers whooped and pranced about as they chased each other around through the square and
			past
			the running fountains. Aestas was laughing so hard that she could hardly breathe.
		</p>
		<p>As they sprinted along the long, low, stone walls that ran along the edge of the terrace, they could see
			the
			ocean simmering, on their left, at the bottom of the long, steep hill. Ships and boats glided on the
			waters
			and headed back towards the harbor. They looked so tiny from Aestas’ point of view. The teenagers
			continued
			past the passageway of the stone-paved stairs that led down to the coast, and ran along the lane.
		</p>
		<p>Ahead of them, two tall figures had just exited one of the shops and were walking slowly up the street,
			in
			the direction of the citadel. Aestas and her friends took a sharp right and followed in their direction,
			and
			soon surpassed the pair.
		</p>
		<p>A sudden wind sent their hair and clothes flapping around wildly; they squealed with laughter and ran
			uphill,
			dragging their long shadows behind them as the sun gradually turned everything into fire-lit-gold in the
			process of its descent.
		</p>
		<p>“Last one to the wind tower loses!” Aestas shouted.
		</p>
		<p class="pend"> “Bet,” Shardow Gier laughed confidently as he sped up, sprinting ahead and leaving his
			friends
			behind.
