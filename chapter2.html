	<p><b class="b">A</b>estas Hyacinth lay under the shadows of a large hawthorn tree, one arm over her eyes. The grass gently brushed her cheeks, blown by the soft summer breeze.
	<p>She was actually supposed to be in the citadel preparing for the upcoming summer festival. But she had snuck out instead, and ran all the way downhill to the south-west borough of Annyo city to join her friends at the crook in the woods. 
	<p>The annual festival, a four-day event, was held to celebrate the start of the summer, and by coincidence, Aestas Hyacinth’s birthday was on the second day. 
	<p>There would be a fair, and numerous parades in Annyo, and a large ball held in the citadel, where a celebration of Aestas’ birthday would take place. The long anticipated list of new recruits and newly appointed officials for the royal army would also be announced that day.
