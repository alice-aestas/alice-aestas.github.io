	<h2 class="chapter title">Abducted </h2>

<div class="chaptercontent">
	<p><b class="b">E</b>sen Ventus glanced down at his shining new badge while being enveloped by the clamoring of the great hall. A wide smile glowed on his face—he was satisfied with his new position. He had just been made second lieutenant of the Royal Windriders Department at the young age of twenty five, which broke the incumbent second lieutenant of the R.S.D. — Fae Baykartte’s record of being the youngest to have reached the position.
	</p>
	<p class="p"><b><i>“May your future be smooth and bright,”</i></b> the second heir of Land Hyacinthous had said to him on stage, after she pinned the new badge to his silky uniform and draped the ivory cloak around his shoulders. 
	</p>
	<p class="p">Esen Ventus felt hopeful for his own future, and was full of ambition— his ultimate goal was to be made general in the end, and no matter the circumstances and challenges, Esen swore nothing would ever faze him. 
	</p>
	<p>As he stood straight, taking in the glory of the white-marbled ballroom, decorated with hyacinths and plumerias, Esen Ventus felt a sudden hot gaze burning the side of his face, and glanced around. He noticed the pair of fierce, olive-green eyes from across the room, and thought for a second, trying to recall where he had seen the familiar face. 
	</p>
	<p><i>“Ah—”</i> the memory resurfacing when he spotted a familiar young blonde enchantress, who stood next to the glaring swordsman. 
	</p>
	<p><i>“Stormy—”</i> the young man whom he ran into at Trina Krelnein’s shop. They locked eyes and the young officer scowled— he did not seem happy to see Esen. Esen, on the other hand, chose to ignore the young swordsman and turned away. 
	</p>
	<p>They <i>will</i> be meeting more frequently in the future.
	</p>
	<p class="p">The crowd started to settle as the warm light of the southern crystals gradually turned dim— signaling that it was time for the birthday celebration to begin. 
	</p>
	<p>Esen, along with the other people in the room bowed one by one, with one hand on the chest, facing the broad stairs in the back and center of the grand hall. 
	</p>
	<p>The second heir of Hyacinth descended down the marble steps slowly, her gloved hand hovering the glossy wooden handrails. The lime green jewels in her gradient brown hair shimmered as the dim crystal light casted upon her, and the ivory hem of her gown flowed around her ankles while the lime-green sashes tied around her waist swayed. The crowd had fallen silent, and the only sounds in the main castle hall were her footsteps and the echoes that followed. She stopped when she reached the bottom of the steps and the crowd held its breath—
	</p>
	<p> A boy about the age of seventeen or eighteen, stepped out from behind the shadows and into the dim circle of light where Aestas Hyacinth stood still, waiting. The lad wore a smart vest of soft brown, over a vanilla white shirt, and dark auburn pants— the same color of his hair. Aestas reached for his extended hand— and the music started playing. 
	</p>
	<p>With a murmur of the royal enchanters, the light omitted from the southern crystals embedded in the ceilings shone bright again, and everyone could see the pair of teenagers that took to the dance floor.
	</p>
	<p><i>“Isn’t that the general’s son?”</i> people murmured, however, not surprised that the first dance of the second heir would be with someone of high status.
	</p>
	<p><i>“Aurelius Solicas?”</i> someone asked, for everyone knew about Aurelius Solicas— the general’s first son, born the same year, one season sooner than the first heir of Hyacinthous. 
	</p>
	<p>However, despite the striking similarity of their features, this wasn’t the twenty year old lad who had raven black hair and burnt amber eyes, but a younger looking seventeen-year old with dark auburn hair and deep orange eyes.
	</p>
	<p class="p">“That’s Aurelius’ younger brother, I think.”
	</p>
	<p>“The general’s second and youngest son.”
	</p>
	<p>“Oh—”
	</p>
	<p>“What’s his name again?”
	</p>
	<p>“I slightly remember that his name is Akti.”
	</p>
	<p>“He looks alot like his older brother, doesn’t he?”
	</p>
	<p>“I wonder if he is as talented as Aurelius Solicas?”
	</p>
	<p class="p">Low murmurs spread out the ballroom as the pair danced together, performing the well rehearsed steps. The lime-green sashes of Aestas Hyacinth’s gown swirled around the both of them as they twirled in circles around the center of the grand ballroom.
	</p>
	<p>“Akti,” Aestas said with her voice hushed. She grinned at her dancing partner. “People are talking about you, Akti.”
	</p>
	<p>Akti Solicas let out a resigned sigh. Normally, he would have been reluctant to dance at any ball, not to mention being the one who performed the first dance.
	</p>
	<p>“I’m glad you agreed to do this,” Aestas said and stuck her tongue out slightly in a playful manner, “thanks for being here with me.”
	</p>
	<p>Originally, when asked to choose a partner for her first dance, Aestas wanted to pick her friend Shardow Gier. However, according to the officials planning the celebration, she could only choose a person of noble status, and Shardow Gier was none of the sort, as he was from a normal household and lived in the outskirts of Dartun heights— one of the residential districts located north of the Citadel, uphill of the business and research district— Barue, and near the northwest woods of Dekota. And it wasn’t as if Aestas didn’t consider asking Tsahn Aouthyerhl and Aurelius Solicas, but Tsahn had always shared the first dance with her older sister, proper as a potential future mate; and as for Aurelius Solicas— as gentle as he was with Aestas, she still feared him a little, due to an indifferent coldness he often wore, that reminded her of her older sister when the girl was in a bad mood. 
	</p>
	<p>Moreover, there was Akti, one of her close friends as well as General Solicas’ son— the perfect candidate. 
	</p>
	<p>The difficult part, however, was to persuade the quiet orange-eyed lad, for he detested being the subject of attention— being known as General Solicas’ son was overwhelming, not to mention the constant comparison with his older brother. And after several days of begging and pestering, the boy gave in to Aestas and agreed to help.
	</p>
	<p class="p">“Don’t mind them,” Aestas told him as the world spun with colors around them. Others had also joined the dance floor. 
	</p>
	<p>“And if it makes you feel any better,” she said, “I understand <i>exactly</i> what it is like to be under evaluation and comparison— all the time”
	</p>
	<p>Akti grinned slightly, he knew she understood, which was one of the reasons they had become such close friends.
	</p>
	<p>“And how’s that doing for you these days?” he asked, a slight grin beginning to form on his face, almost undetectable, but didn’t go unnoticed by Aestas.
	</p>
	<p>“Well,” she replied, “you know how bad it is.”
	</p>
	<p>He nodded, “same.”
	</p>
	<p>“Older siblings,” Aestas groaned and said jokingly— “sometimes we just wish that they would like— disappear for just a while, right?”
	</p>
	<p>At this, Akti Solicas let out a soft laugh and glanced towards the corner of the ballroom where Candentia Hyacinth stood, alongside Tsahn Aouthyerhl and his older brother Aurelius. 
	</p>
	<p>“Or,” Aestas drawled thoughtfully as she gave the trio a tiny wave when she and Akti glided past them, “we could just switch siblings. We both would like that, wouldn’t we? Wouldn’t you?” She wiggled her eyebrows.
	</p>
	<p>Akti blushed and swooshed her away from the trio. “You would like that, you mean. Don’t drag me down with you,” he grumbled.
	</p>
	<p>Looking at Akti’s slightly flustered face, Aestas giggled. Teasing the seemingly cold and serious Akti was one of her favorite hobbies, for she knew that deep down, he was just a shy and gentle soul.
	</p>
	<p>“You are brilliant, Akti, and you should own that,” she said quietly.
	</p>
	<p>At this, Akti gave her hands a tiny squeeze, a small smile visible on his face. His deep orange eyes locked into her lime-green ones for a second before breaking contact again.
	</p>
	<p>“Back at you, Aestas, you are, too. And don’t ever let them get to you.”
	</p>
	<p class="p">“I wager three pounds of amethyst dust that they’re talking shit about us,” Candentia Hyacinth said after making eye contact with the pair that just glided past.
	</p>
	<p>The two lads that stood beside her nodded. “Oh—,” Tsahn Aouthyerhl said, “without a doubt. Look at Aestas’ mischievous smile.”
	</p>
	<p>“Don’t you two have to dance?” Beside them, Aurelius Solicas asked monotonously.  
	</p>
	<p>“How about you join Cadenty in her first dance tonight? Or, on another thought, join me?” Tsahn tilted back, looking past Candentia, and asked Aurelius with a smile.
	</p>
	<p>The amber eyes looked slightly startled, “I’ll pass,” Aurelius said, voice flat, and raised an eyebrow as he gave the other two a sidelong glance, “and why should I want to? That’s dumb. Don’t drag me in between you two.”
	</p>
	<p>“Dumb Aurie,” Tsahn muttered under his breath as Candentia let out a huff and dragged him away and into the swirling pool of colors.
	</p>
	<p>“Don’t mind him,” Candentia said to Tsahn and huffed again, “he can be so annoying sometimes.”
	</p>
	<p>There was a twinkle in Tsahn’s yellow hazel eyes. “Sometimes I can’t fathom how the two of you could continue to be such close friends for so many years,” he laughed, “so do you really get along or do you secretly hate each other?”
	</p>
	<p>Candentia tilted her chin at Aurelius, who stood leaning with his back against the wall, watching with a dark gaze. “I guess it’s safe to say that we hate each other very much,” she scowled, sending daggers at the raven-head over Tsahn’s shoulder. He returned the glare . “I swear that he wouldn’t even bat an eye if I happened to disappear one day,” she deadpanned. 
	</p>
	<p>“Aww, I highly doubt that,” Tsahn mused as he twirled the girl around in circles, the midnight-blue ribbons swaying as her ash black curls flowed along.
	</p>
	<p>“Dizzy,” Candentia panted, after Tsahn had caught her in his arms, and was feeling slightly dazed. “Spin me around the other way,” she demanded.  
	</p>
	<p>Tsahn did as he was told. 
	</p>
	<p>“Better?” he laughed, to which his companion nodded, pump lips slightly parted.
	</p>
	<p>“You can spin circles around the others in combat training, but you can’t handle dancing?” he teased.
	</p>
	<p>“That’s… different,” she averted her gaze with a small huff, “and you know that dancing is not my strong suit.”
	</p>
	<p>“That I do know,” he replied with a chuckle, “for as your dancing companion, I am mostly the victim of your poor performance. Maybe that’s the reason why Aurie refused to dance with you in the first place. Tsk, tsk, can’t blame him.”
	</p>
	<p>He winced as Candenia stepped on his toes.
	</p>
	<p>“Cadenty,” he pouted, “that was on purpose, wasn’t it?” he accused. Candentia pretended not to hear him.
	</p>
	<p>“Aurie, Aurie,” she said instead, “it’s actually amazing that he lets us call him that. Normally he would have killed the person that called him by his childhood nickname.”
	</p>
	<p>“He is actually quite gentle and kind, you know?” 
	</p>
	<p>“Yeah, I know,” she sighed, “but it’ll be better if he shows it, though. I feel like he has become more and more aggressive when we interact with each other these days.” 
	</p>
	<p>“That,” Tsahn raised his eyebrows and smiled, “you are at fault, too. You both are really bad at expressing emotions.”
	</p>
	<p>“Oh, and you’re so good at it?” she smirked.
	</p>
	<p>“At least I’m better at it than the two of you!” he protested as he spun her around in playful revenge, to which she let out a tiny yelp. 
	</p>
	<p>“Do you know how much effort I have to put in just to keep the peace between the three of us?” he asked after catching her again.
	</p>
	<p>She panted in defeat, holding on to Tsahn for dear life
	</p>
	<p>“Yes,” she said monotonously, her eyes blinking. “You’re right. You win. The two of us owe you that much.” 
	</p>
	<p>However, when she lifted her face again, her gray eyes were full of laughter. 
	</p>
	<p>“But however you complain, I can almost be sure that you’ll never give up on us,” she said, grinning slyly, “you like us a lot, don’t you?”
	</p>
	<p>Tshan looked amused as he gazed down into the depthless gray.
	</p>
	<p>“That I do,” he said softly, before glancing over to the side of the room. Aurelius was still watching them, the amber eyes dark with imperceivable emotion. 
	</p>
	<p>“That I do.”
	</p>
	<p class="p">The trio were in a heated discussion about what to do together the day after, when it was far into the night. The music in the ballroom had turned into a much cheerful and lively tone.
	</p>
	<p> Candentia Hyacinth suddenly stopped talking— both Tsahn and Aurelius looked at her in inquiry.
	</p>
	<p>“Two o’clock direction, from my view,” she said under her breath, “oh, the person turned around already— so you can’t see his face now, but have you seen the guy anywhere before?”
	</p>
	<p>The two glanced around subtly and saw the subject Candentia was talking about. The person had on a simple white shirt and black pants, and was staring intently at one side of the ballroom. Aurelius Solicas sucked in a sharp breath as he saw where the stranger’s gaze could have landed. Dancing with a caramel blond-haired and forest-green-eyed lad, laughing her heart out, was Aestas Hyacinth. Aurelius turned his gaze back on the ivory-haired person. 
	</p>
	<p>The stranger soon ceased his staring at the dance floor and turned away to some girls and bowed. The small group of girls giggled and blushed. He seemed to have asked one of them for a dance, for a young lady with a sage colored gown accepted his hand and followed the ivory haired lad into the crowd, to the dance floor. Aurelius and Tsahn both caught a glimpse of his side profile when he turned slightly, murmuring something into his companion’s ear— he was rather tall and had a sharp jawline. His thin lips were tugged into a confident smirk, showing his teeth. They couldn’t see his eyes, however, which were covered with the soft strands of ivory hair.
	</p>
	<p>“He could have been staring anywhere, and not at Aestas…” Tsahn said comfortingly to Candentia.
	</p>
	<p>“Yeah…” her voice sounded uncertain, “but I think I noticed him before at the R.A. announcement ceremony.”
	</p>
	<p>“You worried?” Aurelius asked, glancing sideways at Candentia.
	</p>
	<p>She hummed. 
	</p>
	<p>“Should we just take her back to the Nix?” Aurelius asked.
	</p>
	<p>“No,” Candentia said, “it’s her sweet sixteen, and she deserves a little bit of fun. I have been hard on her these days, and I don’t want to ruin her birthday also.” She beckoned for their ears, and said quietly in a serious tone when they leaned down towards her, “if the ivory-haired guy truly meant to do any harm on Aestas, he wouldn’t dare to strike just now, when we’re surrounded with so many people. And there’s still the possibility of me just being paranoid.”
	</p>
	<p>Tsahn shook his head, his soft honey brown hair swished from side to side. “Better safe than sorry,” he said, to which Aurelius nodded silently.
	</p>
	<p>Candentia let out a small sigh of relief, “I’m glad you both view it that way,” she took a deep breath, “to make sure that Aestas is safe, I’m relying on you two to take her to the basements of the R.A. departments as soon as the last note of the last dance goes silent, and do it before anyone else notices. Keep it a secret just in case word slips out of where she went.”
	</p>
	<p>Tsahn Aouthyerhl and Aurelius Solicas nodded.
	</p>
	<p>“In the meantime, I’m going to find Esen Ventus and ask him to keep an eye out for anything strange, while you two look after Aestas.”
	</p>
	<p>“Cadenty,” Tsahn looked concerned, “you be careful yourself. Don’t go chasing after danger, do you hear me?”
	</p>
	<p>Candentia patted his shoulder assuringly and said, “I’ll meet you guys at the R.A. department buildings afterwards, don’t worry. And after we’re sure everythings alright, we’ll head back to the Nix together. Take care of Aestas, and don’t leave her side no matter what happens.”
	</p>
	<p>“She’s in good hands,” Tsahn promised.
	</p>
	<p>The corners of her plump lips lifted into a grateful smile, “thanks,” she said to the boys, “I’m sorry for ruining this night for you.”
	</p>
	<p>“Nothing to be sorry about,” Aurelius said coldly, “it’s not like we don’t understand.”
	</p>
	<p>She chuckled softly, and murmured, “...thanks,” gave them a pat on the back and headed to the other ballroom in search of Esen Ventus— the newly appointed second lieutenant, someone she could trust to carry out any secret missions.
	</p>
	<p>Candentia Hyacinth was almost through the tall doorway when someone reached out and grabbed her arm harshly. She turned and saw Aurelius Solicas, his burnt-amber eyes were fierce as they gazed into her gray ones.
	</p>
	<p><i>“Cadi,”</i> he breathed, his expression serious, “come immediately to us after you finish what is necessary.”
	</p>
	<p>Are you worried about me? Candentia refrained herself from asking, for she knew he wouldn’t answer. So instead, she gently wiggled her arm out of Aurelius’ firm grasp and slipped off her gloves and long midnight-blue cloak. She wore a short midi dress underneath, and her previous gloved hands were now in another pair of fingerless gloves. Aurelius stared blankly at her and she smiled.   
	</p>
	<p>“Keep them for me, will you?” she said gently— a tone he rarely heard from her these days, for they usually quarreled and bickered. Aurelius reached out and held the smooth clothings in his hands.
	</p>
	<p>“Well, that’s goodbye then,” she laughed softly when Aurelius didn’t respond. “I’ll see you in a bit,” She gave his hand a reassuring squeeze before she turned away again. 
	</p>
	<p>Stay safe, he opened his mouth to say, but stopped and swallowed the words instead, and watched as the girl dressed in ivory and midnight blue disappeared into the crowd of the other ballroom. 
	</p>
	<p>As she said, he’ll see her in a bit.
	</p>
	<p class="p">“So, what is it?” Aestas asked, annoyed. “Was there really a weirdo or is she just paranoid? Or does Candentia want to scare me into behaving in the future?” 
	</p>
	<p>She had been nearly dragged out of the main castle and to one of the training rooms in the basement of the Royal Army department buildings by Tsahn and Aurelius right after the party ended. She had wanted to stay longer and chat with her friends, but got pulled aside almost immediately, where the two explained the situation. She couldn’t understand why of all times her sister chose the night of her birthday to practice the drill.
	</p>
	<p>“Is the drill over?” she asked again.
	</p>
	<p>“Not a drill,” Aurelius told her, and from the tone of his voice, she could tell that he was being serious. But on the other hand, Aurelius was ultimately on Candentia’s side, even if the two would both deny, so she didn’t know if she should believe his words.
	</p>
	<p>“We’ll head back when Cadenty gets here,” Tsahn said.
	</p>
	<p>It was, however, almost past midnight when Tsahn Aouthyerhl, Aurelius Solicas, and Aestas Hyacinth heard that there had been some commotion down at the main castle.
	</p>
	<p>“What happened?” Aurelius grabbed one of the guards that ran past the door, and asked. The guards were heading towards the direction of the storage rooms where weapons were kept.
	</p>
	<p>“Someone broke into the main castle,” one of the guards said, panting, “and had knocked out all the guards and R.A. members that tried to stop him.”
	</p>
	<p>“All of them?” Tsahn sucked in a breath.
	</p>
	<p>“I’m going over there,” Aurelius said to Tsahn, “stay here and watch Aestas.”
	</p>
	<p>“Wait! Aurie—” Tsahn called, but Aurelius had already disappeared out the door.
	</p>
	<p class="p">“What in the Csettrecsran happened!” the king bellowed. He had just learned the news that the main castle had been broken in and his oldest daughter was missing. “And who is this guy? How on Csettrecsran  did you let him single-handedly defeat all the guards, swordsmen, and even windriders?”
	</p>
	<p>“My lord, there’s no way to convey how sorry we are…” Esen Ventus said as he stepped out from the row of R.A. officials that were standing straight in a line in front of the King of Land Hyacinthous.
	</p>
	<p>“Your daughter had come to me and had asked me to keep an eye out for anything weird before it happened, but to my dismay, it wasn’t until the attack did I know who I should be aware of. The guy was well trained in both combat and sorcery. And although no one saw his face, we have some clue of where he might come from.”
	</p>
	<p>“Where does he come from and how do you know?”
	</p>
	<p>“General Solicas’ son happened to find some crystal debris beside Candentia Hyacinth’s shattered ice spears and dagger.”
	</p>
	<p>“Aurelius?” the king jerked his head up.
	</p>
	<p>“Yes, my lord. Aurelius Solicas and Tsahn Aouthyerhl happened to have taken your second daughter to safety under Candentia Hyacinth’s orders long before the attack happened. Aurelius came running to the scene as soon as he heard about the attack.”
	</p>
	<p>“I see,” the king said, “and you were saying? What about the crystal debris?”
	</p>
	<p>“It is Northern Crystal, my lord” a slim man with ivory hair and grayish blue eyes spoke up. The man’s name is Hashier Coulnaur, and he is the first lieutenant of the R.E.D., with the age of forty five.
	</p>
	<p>“Northern Crystals?” the king echoed, “are you sure? Lieutenant Coulnaur?”
	</p>
	<p>Hashier Coulnaur pushed the rim of his glasses and replied with certainty, though there was also a quiver in his voice, “yes, I’m sure. And they’re fresh and functionable, which means that whoever did this could be from the north.”
	</p>
	<p>The king drew a sharp breath. This doesn’t sound promising. If the first heir of Hyacinth is alive and is a captive of the North, Land Hyacinthous would certainly have to do something in exchange for the hostage’s life, and the king could guess a few conditions the North might ask him of. Not good.
	</p>
	<p>“Send for General Solicas,” he said, for General Solicas was not in Land Hyacinthous at the moment, and he needed the general to be here with the grave situation.
	</p>
	<p>“And when he arrives, gather all the remaining officials of the R.A. for an emergency meeting. In the meantime, I’m going to check on my daughter.”
	</p>
	<p class="p">Back in his bedroom, Aurelius Solicas covered his eyes with his arm as he lay on his bed. He clenched his fists so hard that it trembled. 
	</p>
	<p>The coolness of Candentia’s fingers, when she squeezed his hands and handed the clothings to him, still lingered. 
	</p>
	<p>The sight of his last glimpse of her ash black hair and gray eyes kept replaying in his mind, and he let out a growl of frustration and regret. 
	</p>
	<p>When he rushed up to the balcony on the highest floor of the main castle’s east wing, he found in despair that there were numerous traces of ice and blood, and all that was left of Candentia Hyacinth was a blue ribbon cut in half hanging on the railings, while the girl herself was nowhere to be seen. 
	</p>
	<i><p class="p">If only… 
	</p>
	<p>If only he had stayed with her. 
	</p>
	<p>If only he had come sooner. 
	</p></i>
	<p class="p">Aurelius clenched his jaw.
	</p>
	<p>Whoever did this, is going to pay. 
	</p>
	<p class="pend">He will make them, no matter who it was.
	</p>
