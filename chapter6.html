<div class="chaptercontent">
	<p><b class="b">T</b>he halls of the main castle building were weirdly quiet, the long shadows of the late afternoon stretched across the long, brown carpet. Completely still, were the even lines; while the irregular shapes quivered slightly when the cool, dry air stirred outside, making the leaves rustle, movements so light that it was almost undetectable. Shades of crimson red and flaming orange slanted through the tall windows, and splashed onto the grayish, white marble walls. Absent of the usual buzzing chatter, the floors were filled with an eerie silence— without a figure to be seen. 
	</p>
	<p>A tiny shadow appeared suddenly, in the stillness of the hall, fluttering in an unpredictable route through the long, rectangular blocks of cool, golden sunlight—the small butterfly must’ve slipped past one of the open doors on the ground floor, and up the open staircases, eventually losing its way through the complicated turns of the corridors. It flew mindlessly through the empty halls, trying to find a way out, and finally arrived at a long hallway with tall windows lining one side. The familiarity of the shape of leaves led its instincts, drawing the tiny insect towards the natural light, only for it to bump against the glass of the clean windows. Not knowing what blocked its way, the butterfly flew along the invisible shield, butting helplessly into yet another dead end, trapped. 
	</p>
	<p>A large figure loomed over the small creature all of a sudden, and a hand reached out—
	</p>
	<p>“There you go,” Aestas said to the small butterfly. It crawled across her palm, antennas flicking. “You’re free now.”
	</p>
	<p>Catching a small gust of wind, the butterfly fluttered away, its icy blue wings almost white against the golden sunlight. Aestas stood on the balcony at the end of the hallway and watched the delicate thing disappear in the distance. She reached out her hand unconsciously, fingers extended, as if trying to grasp at the remaining dust that shimmered. A sudden lump rose in her throat and she let her hand fall limply back to her side. 
	</p>
	<p>The early autumn sky was as calm as a quiet pond. “As if everything was the way it was,” Aestas thought before shutting her eyelids, holding back the tears that threatened to drop. 
	</p>
	<p>“Not now,” she scolded herself, clutching the sides of her dark green dress, “not now.”
	</p>
	<p>A wavering sigh slipped past her lips as she let the early chill of the new season settle, before turning back, returning to the dead silence of the long halls.
	</p>
	<p>One of the tall wooden doors opened and a young woman peeked out from behind. Her baby blue eyes held a tinge of relief when she noticed the young heir of Hyacinth.
	</p>
	<p>“Lady Aestas,” she called, and beckoned to the girl, “there you are.”
	</p>
	<p>“Ms. Krelnein,” Aestas greeted as she hurried over, “how are things going in there?”
	</p>
	<p>“Not too well,” Trina Krelnein replied with honesty, though her tone was light, “the situation with the north is still worsening, I’m afraid.”
	</p>
	<p>She led Aestas across the empty room, the lower half of her cloak flowing behind, the midnight black rippled while the upper half of rich purple hugged her shoulders. Her blonde hair, braided into a ponytail, swayed to the tempo of her light footsteps. 
	</p>
	<p>“Problems regarding the search team are yet to be discussed,” Trina said, as they passed through a wide doorway, and headed towards yet another tall door, “the king was waiting for you to begin.”
	</p>
	<p>Aestas had previously begged her father, the King, to allow her to attend his meetings with the R.A. officials, regarding the search of her sister. After some pleading, the king gave in to his daughter— it was time for the second heir to be officially introduced to the R.A. officials after all. And Aestas was told to show up on the day of the main assembly of all officials, after the first session of the afternoon briefing. 
	</p>
	<p> However, as the long awaited event came near, Aestas felt a sense of dread and reluctancy. 
	</p>
	<p>First of all, she feared what she would hear in the discussions regarding her lost sister— no good news had been delivered to Annyo so far, and it was hard to bear. Second of all, it would be her first time meeting all the officials of the R.A., which the pressure was beyond imagination…
	</p>
	<p>She <i>did</i> know some of them: Arcani Sulvin, the old mage, for example, who had been made general of the Royal Enchanters Department for almost fifteen years. He had been quite the grandfather figure to Candentia and Aestas. There is also Erai Solicas, whom Aestas had met several times already— Akti’s father, the general of the Royal Swordsmen Department, and also a close friend of her parents. Apart from the two generals, she also knew Trina Krelnein. The young enchantress was introduced to Aestas by Candentia when the older took her down to alleys of Pagiet lane, and into the wonders of “Krelnein’s badges.” And having already met with the newly appointed officials, such as Esen Ventus, made it a total of eight R.A. officials that she was acquainted with. Not many, but enough for a second heir that had just turned sixteen. Still, the thought of being in the same room as so many important people was unnerving, and Aestas’ desire to turn away grew with every step towards the war room. 
	</p>
	<p>“We’re here,” Trina Krelnein said softly, as she stepped aside, “after you, Lady Aestas.”
	</p>
	<p>The doors were now held open by the guards, and Aestas took in a big breath before passing through. The young enchantress threw an encouraging smile at the Hyacinth, who smiled back nervously.
	</p>
	<p>A fresh scent of the forest wafted past Trina as Aestas Hyacinth stepped past. The enchantress smiled to herself and shook her head defeatedly— it seems like the teenager had snuck out of the citadel again. 
	</p>
	<p>A shiver ran down Aestas’ spine— the officials of the Royal Army had looked up from their seats upon her entrance. She gulped again, nearly paralyzed by the sudden pressure, and forged a bright smile. 
	</p>
	<p>“Aestas,” her father beckoned, “come here.” The King was sitting by a large marble table at the front of the room; the three generals of the R.A. were seated on the other side, while their subordinates sat nine by twenty, in rows spread out, filling up the rest of the room. The officials, including the three generals, stood up almost simultaneously when the king rose to his feet. He smiled warmly at Aestas and drew her near, a firm hand settled on her shoulder.
	</p>
	<p>“Don’t be nervous, little one,” he whispered, as he gave her shoulders an encouraging squeeze. Although still tense, Aestas felt more relaxed, and giggled softly, this time showing her teeth. 
	</p>
	<p>“You ready now?” the king asked in a hushed voice, to which Aestas nodded. He winked at her before turning to face the numerous officials of the R.A.
	</p>
	<p>“As some of you might know,” his rich voice rang out through the room, “my daughter will be joining us in meetings occasionally from now on.”
	</p>
	<p>He made a small gesture with his right hand, palms facing the ground and slightly pushing down. The members sat back down immediately in sync, and Aestas could feel the intensity of their gaze land upon her.
	</p>
	<p>“This is my daughter, Aestas Fleur Hyacinth,” the king said, with a hint of pride and adoration detectible in his voice. “She was born of Summer, the same as I am. And is brilliant at both combat and enhancement casting.”
	</p>
	<p>“She will be attending some of the meetings from now on,” he continued, voice calm but full of authority, “and I ask you to show her some kindness and respect. She is after all— ” he looked sideways at his daughter.
	</p>
	<p>“The pride of the throne.”
	</p>
	<p>Aestas stood stunned upon the sudden praise. Something inside her stirred as a small tinge of unexplainable guilt crept into her guts.  
	</p>
	<p><i>I don’t deserve it</i>— a small voice sounded in her head. She placed a hand over her heart, which had warmed up at the words, despite herself. She never really thought herself to be good enough, and the pressure of living up to the title of the Hyacinths had always felt like something that she could never conquer. But hearing her father’s affirmation, which had been delivered to her in front of all the officials of the R.A., her confidence somehow surged, as well as her ambition, and she was determined to win over their trust and adoration.
	</p>
	<p>She scanned the room and noticed how the colors of green, blue, and purple evenly divided the officials into three sections. Their cloaks of different patterns represented their ranks in the army, with the base color a serious midnight black for those in the back, and bright ivory for those near the front, while the three generals were all dressed in full department colors. 
	</p>
	<p>Erai Solicas nodded at Aestas when she sat down opposite of him, beside her father. It had been a while since she saw the general, as he had been away for quite some time, being in charge of guarding the borders in the north. A few new wrinkles were drawn on the side of his eyes, and a few strands of gray laced in between his strands of auburn hair. He held a grim expression, so did the other two generals on his side. Aestas bowed her head slightly, smiling weakly to herself—
	</p>
	<p><i>Grave times, indeed.</i>
	</p><br><br><br>
	<p class="p">The sound of twigs snapping echoed through the forest.
	</p>
	<p class="p">“Arggg!” 
	</p>
	<p>Aestas swung with rage as she ran, wielding the short sword her sister had gifted her on her birthday. The blade glowed with a fierce golden light as sharp waves of wind shot out, nipping the branches and flower stems. The abundance of fallen leaves provided a carpet of crimson chaos that swirled after the girl.
	</p>
	<p>“Please! Aestas!” Akti called desperately after her. The wind that Aestas had drawn from the sword pulsed strong, pushing against him, one wave after another, as Akti struggled to catch up.
	</p>
	<p>“Aestas!” he shouted, the howling wind and rustling leaves drowned out his voice, “stop! Please! You’re going to hurt yourself.”
	</p>
	<p>The girl ignored the faint calls and kept on running, slashing at yet another branch. A bright light flashed, and the brown branch broke even before being touched by the blade. 
	</p>
	<p><i>It couldn’t be real. No, it couldn’t be. </i>
	</p>
	<p>Aestas stumbled mindlessly through the woods, her vision blurred. 
	</p>
	<p><i>It can’t be! </i>
	</p>
	<p>The unbearable fear of never being able to see her sister again just came true.
	</p>
	<p class="p">Aestas had just returned to the Nix that afternoon after her lessons at the academy, when she noticed how the place seemed to be under an air of unexplained anxiety.
	</p>
	<p>“Whatever is the problem?” she asked as she handed her cloak to one of the attendants in the main hall.
	</p>
	<p>“The afternoon papers had just been printed in town apparently,” the man answered, brows furrowed, “though I have not yet had the time to read it myself. It seemed to have caused quite a stir.”
	</p>
	<p>“Is Tsahn home?” Aestas asked. A bad feeling had crept into her stomach, though she tried to remain calm.
	</p>
	<p>“Yes,” the attendant answered, “he is with the Solicas brothers in the sitting room, I believe.”
	</p>
	<p>“Excuse me, then,” Aestas hurried across the halls, tightening her grasp on the short sword that hung to her waist. She sprinted down the long corridors and burst through the doors of the back kitchen— a short cut to the inner rooms of the Nix.
	</p>
	<p>A group of scullery maids were in a heated discussion, surrounding one that held onto a copy of the afternoon papers.
	</p>
	<p>“Did something bad happen?” Aestas asked as she approached them.
	</p>
	<p>“Lady Hyacinth!” they hurried to form a line and curtsied.
	</p>
	<p>The one in the center hid the copy behind her back. The woman looked rather young, and had a few soft freckles on her cheeks.
	</p>
	<p>“Are those the afternoon town papers?” Aestas said, reaching out her hand, “may I?”
	</p>
	<p>The maid hesitated, her soft brown eyes gazing back at the young mistress. “It’s merely town gossip, my lady.”
	</p>
	<p>“Well, does the gossip have something to do with my sister’s whereabouts?” Aestas asked.
	</p>
	<p>The maids exchanged anxious glances. 
	</p>
	<p>“Yes, my lady,” one of them said meekly, earning a subtle kick from her older colleague.
	</p>
	<p>“Then I shall see what it is about, should I not?” Aestas’ hand was extended stubbornly. “I’ll keep it a secret if you hand over the copy in this instance,” she said in a sweet tone, “for I am aware of the trouble you might get yourselves in if your superiors found out about this.”
	</p>
	<p>“Give her the papers,” one of the older maids whispered in her colleague’s ear. The young maid handed over the papers with reluctancy. 
	</p>
	<p>“Thank you,” Aestas said, smiling ever so sweetly, “forgive me of the subtle threat just now.”
	</p>
	<p>The maids smiled back, curtsying clumsily with unease.
	</p>
	<p>“Please keep in mind that it is not official news, my lady,” another one of the younger maids with blue eyes tried cautiously, for she feared how the young heir would react.
	</p>
	<p>And as Aestas Hyacinth glanced down at the papers in her hand, her face froze. For there on the very first page, was her sister’s name, under the bold print of <b class="alice">“Disappeared or Dead?”</b>
	</p><br>

	<div class="c4paper">
	<p class="alice">“After a season of waiting for a response from the North, land Hyacinthous has now come to face some grave news.” 
	</p>
	<p>— the paper wrote.
	</p><br>
	<p class="alice">“Upon the arrival of the trader ships of the west, it seems that word has gone out that a week before the autumn harvest in the northern lands, both heirs of Hellebore and Hyacinth had disappeared from the great lands. Although the North has not yet confirmed the legitimacy of the rumor, it is said that the King and the officials of Land Hyacinthous are in discussion for an official declaration of war, if the death of the first heir of Hyacinth turns out to be true.”
	</p>
	</div>

	<p class="p">Aestas had run down the halls hastily, paper in hand, while the words echoed in her mind—
	</p><br>

	<div class="c4paper">
	<p class="alice">“Followed by the news of the disappearance of Candentia Hyacinth and her said captor, Lansher Hellebore, our very own royal enchanters had set out to determine whether it was merely a false alarm. However, after yet another week of searching for traces of their powers, our land must now face the inevitable truth that the first heir of Hyacinth might not be—  putting it gently— present among the living anymore.”
	</p>
	</div>

	<p class="p">“Tsahn!” Aestas cried out, as she burst into the sitting room. She stopped to see that both Akti and Aurelius Solicas were there. 
	</p>
	<p>“Aetsas—” Tsahn Aouthyerhl started. The Solicas brothers rose at her entrance, but remained silent, looking pale. The three boys all appeared lost and distraught.
	</p>
	<p>“The papers— have you read them?” Then she saw that he did, in fact, as one wrinkled copy was spread out on the low tea table in the center of the sitting room. 
	</p>
	<p>“It isn’t true, right?” she cried, running over to Tsahn and looking the older in the eyes. The empty gaze in his eyes made her stomach drop.
	</p>
	<p>“Tell me it isn’t true,” she pleaded.
	</p>
	<p>Tsahn closed his eyes and let out a shaky breath. “I would rather not jump into any rash conclusions,” he said, “but I’m afraid the situation is fraught with grim possibilities.”
	</p>
	<p>“So there is still hope then?” Aestas asked, desperate for an answer.
	</p>
	<p>“I wouldn’t dare say—” Tsahn stammered, stumbling slightly, “I—”
	</p>
	<p>Aurelius stepped forward, took hold of the young Hyacinth, and guided her to the soft, brown couch. 
	</p>
	<p>“From what I heard,” he said, after having sat her down carefully, “I would recommend preparing for the worst of news.”
	</p>
	<p>“From what you heard?” Aestas gazed at him. “What did you hear, Aurelius?”
	</p>
	<p>Beside them, Akti shifted with unease.
	</p>
	<p>“Please, do go on,” she urged. She desperately needed to know.
	</p>
	<p>“Well,” Aurelius kneeled down to level his gaze with hers.
	</p>
	<p>“No trace of her powers were found.”
	</p>
	<p>“And what of it?” Aestas strained, “the incapability of the trackers might be the factor to blame.” 
	</p>
	<p>“General Sulvin had taken to the matters personally,” Aurelius said, “and even he confirmed that there were indeed no traces of her powers left.” It was well known that the general of the Royal Enchanters’ Department, the old mage as he is, is one of the greatest sorcerers that had ever lived, and specializes in boundary enchantments and power detecting. Aestas sat there motionless, stunned in despair. 
	</p>
	<p>“They came back with the news just this afternoon,” Akti whispered, “you were at the academy at that time.”
	</p>
	<p>“But—” Aestas shook her head, she couldn’t give up just yet, “maybe something happened and she just lost all her powers. Maybe that’s the reason.”
	</p>
	<p>Aurelius reached out and held her hands gently in his. The coldness of his fingers made Aestas tremble slightly. “Powers such as your sister’s,” he said, “the kind that runs through your families’ bloodline, don’t simply vanish. And to extricate that type of power from a person, it would take more than twenty enchanters, or more, to do so, not mentioning the awfulness and cruelty of the procedures.” 
	</p>
	<p>Although his voice was gentle, Aurelius’ eyes were dark, and full of pain. “It would have killed her anyways if what you suggest did happen.”
	</p>
	<p>Aestas jerked her hands away and buried her face in her palms. 
	</p>
	<p>“Oh— stop all that,” she wailed, “how could any of this have happened?” Unable to contain herself anymore, her voice broke, as well as her heart.
	</p>
	<p>“If it was true that the northerner was coming for me, how could it have happened? If Candentia had just learned to stop—”
	</p>
	<p>“Her body—” Aestas looked up, having suddenly recalled not reading about it in the paper. “What about my sister’s body? If she is— ” she swallowed hard, “dead, as the news claims her to be. Where is her body?”
	</p>
	<p>“It has not yet been found,” Aurelius replied quietly, standing back up.
	</p>
	<p>“What about her hyacinth ice sculpture?” she asked desperately, reaching out to Tsahn. “It is still in bloom, isn’t it?”
	</p>
	<p>He took her hand and allowed her to pull him closer.
	</p>
	<p class="p">The members of the Hyacinth family each had a sculpture of their house flower created with their own powers since they each came of age, and stored away in a room of the main castle. 
	</p>
	<p>As a person that wielded the powers of the wind, Aestas’ sculpture was made of soft cotton and sand, while her sister’s was made of ice and stone. It was said that even with the faintest of powers the sculptures would bloom, as long as the family member was alive and breathing. Aestas believed it to be true, for she had witnessed how her grandfather’s hyacinth flower crumbled to dust when he passed away. And even after the abduction of her older sister, the transparent flower that represented the girl’s powers still stayed in bloom. 
	</p>
	<p>The room that stored the flowers was normally locked up for good reason, however, and Aestas did not have the liberty of checking on the power detectors whenever she pleased.
	</p>
	<p>“Isn’t it? Answer me!” Aestas demanded, anxiety rising up when Tsahn refused to look her in the eye. 
	</p>
	<p>The truth was, Tsahn Aoutheyerhl didn’t have access to the sculpture rooms either, and overheard nothing but the word “melted,” when he paid the queen a visit the day before. 
	</p>
	<p>One of the well esteemed enchantresses of the R.E.D. had been led into the large room where Tsahn and the queen sat, having a rather light conversation despite the harsh times. The queen was somehow like a second mother to Tsahn, for she had taken gentle care of him, especially during his first few years at Annyo city. And after the terrible incident that made the king and the officials decide for Tsahn and Candentia to move to the Nix, the queen was the only person to have visited him at the infirmary. Tsahn had often tagged along behind Candentia, when she visited her mother at the main castle, to which the gentle women would beckon for him to enter the room as well. 
	</p>
	<p>He kept the habit of visiting the queen even in the absence of Candentia. The enchantress had whispered in the queen’s ear, to which the queen had risen up rather hastily, almost knocking over the table and spilling the tea. 
	</p>
	<p>“Forgive me,” she had apologized to Tsahn, “there is something urgent I need to tend to.”
	</p>
	<p>“May I accompany you, my lady?” Tsahn had asked hastily, hoping to confirm that his speculations were wrong. He was almost sure that he caught the words “sculpture” and “melted,” which made his heart drop. 
	</p>
	<p>Queen Merythdian , however, had shook her head with a forced smile. 
	</p>
	<p>“I thank you for the gesture. You surely had grown into a thoughtful lad,” she said gently, “but this is a rather intimate family matter. I’m afraid you would have to leave me be.”
	</p>
	<p>“Don’t you worry,” she let out a soft chuckle, upon seeing the visible strain in Tsahn’s expression, “everything is going to be alright. Now, now— be a good lad and go back home.” 
	</p>
	<p>“Yes, my lady,” Tsahn said quietly. The enchantress bowed her head slightly when they met eyes.
	</p>
	<p>“Tsahn,” Queen Merythdian stopped at the door and turned back around.
	</p>
	<p>“Yes, my lady?” He stood up straight.
	</p>
	<p>“Thank you for your kindness,” she gave him a sad smile, “visit me some other time, will you?”
	</p>
	<p>“Of course,” Tsahn replied with a bow, “it will be my pleasure.”
	</p>
	<p class="p">“I’m not the one you should be asking on the matter,” was all Tsahn could say to the second heir of Hyacinth. 
	</p>
	<p>“It seems like a rather intimate “family” matter. And I dare not speak of it.”
	</p>
	<p>“What’s with the sudden formality?” Aestas shook his arms slightly, “you are family, too. Aren’t you supposedly Candentia’s betrothed?”
	</p>
	<p>At this, both Tsahn and Aurelius glanced away. 
	</p>
	<p>“That— is a matter I no longer know the answer to,” he let out a strained laugh. Aestas froze upon the realization—  what would become of Tsahn Aouthyerhl if her sister really is gone? Would he be sent home? Or would they be—  she rubbed her face with her palms to stop the thoughts from spiraling.
	</p>
	<p>“Why weren’t you with her that night?” Aestas asked suddenly, turning once again to the older boys. 
	</p>
	<p>The crisp clink sounded as Tsahn placed a glass down on the table. He wiped the edges of his mouth with his sleeve rather harshly, swallowing. 
	</p>
	<p>Aurelius, who hadn’t uttered a word for a long time, sat down opposite of her and buried his face in his palms. “My thoughts precisely,” he murmured.  
	</p>
	<p>“She needed the two of us to look after you,” Tsahn said gently, eyeing Aurelius with caution. “To make sure you were safe.” His fingers hovered above the empty glass for a moment, before reaching for another one.
	</p>
	<p>“Both of you?” she rolled her eyes, “just how untrustworthy did she consider me be?”
	</p>
	<p>Aurelius looked up, the burnt amber eyes held a hint of disbelief, to which Aestas dodged his gaze, wincing.
	</p>
	<p>“She—” Aestas took a sharp breath and crossed her arms, “you said that she went to fetch help that night— did she say where she was going?”
	</p>
	<p>“To find Esen Ventus. Yes,” Tsahn replied, voice wary. “Though she must’ve gone for the suspect herself after.”
	</p>
	<p>“Are we seriously having this conversation right now?” Aurelius tried to keep his voice soft, but it came out rather as a venomous hiss.
	</p>
	<p>“Brother—” Akti said quietly, finally speaking again.
	</p>
	<p>Something in Aestas Hyacinth snapped, and she let out a cold laugh; her sight suddenly blurred by tears. 
	</p>
	<p>“Yes!” she cried out, “yes, we are having this conversation at this very moment. Why?” she let out a snort, “does it bother you?” 
	</p>
	<p>Aurelius jerked his head aside and casted his burning gaze on the floor. Tsahn, on the other hand, put down the glass in his hands and stepped back into the circle.
	</p>
	<p>“I really did have enough,” Aestas said, voice raised, “I’m sick of you all protecting her perfect image when in reality she made a fatal mistake this time. She just couldn’t resist doing everything herself, couldn’t she?” she continued with accusation laced in her voice, “and you two just couldn’t think of doing anything other than what she commanded, couldn’t you?”
	</p>
	<p>“Aestas—” Tsahn reached out a hand, of which Aestas swatted away. 
	</p>
	<p>“I’m not wrong, though, am I?” she cried. “If it weren’t for— for her recklessness, or— or your inability to disobey her for once, none of it would have happened, and we— we wouldn’t have had to go through all this.” 
	</p>
	<p>It certainly wasn’t what she intended to say, but it was all that spilled out of her mouth. She wiped her face with the back of her hand and turned away. It was unbearable to look either one of them in the eye, and she loathed how Aurelius’ gaze seemed to be anything but anger; Tsahn’s nothing but commiseration. 
	</p>
	<p>“Why don’t you say something?” she said, voice still raised, “come on— be angry. I need you two to fucking fight with me! I know that you have always wanted to blame me for my actions ever since that day. Fucking start now, do you hear me? Now is the time— come on—” she strained, flinging out her arms in frustration. 
	</p>
	<p>“Urgg! Do you two seriously don’t have minds of your own? How can anyone remain this emotionless after all of this?” she gestured to herself, “are you really so void of feelings? Or are you just incapable of displaying any emotions?”
	</p>
	<p>“You’re grieving,” Tsahn whispered, “and we understand that.”
	</p>
	<p>“<i>Grieve?</i>” Aestas retreated towards the door, “what is there to grieve about? Her death is not yet confirmed, isn’t it?”
	</p>
	<p>Aurelius rose to his feet. 
	</p>
	<p>“Can’t you understand?” He said with a slight tremble, “it is in fact confirmed, by the enchanters, that there was indeed no trace of her powers anywhere,” he said, voice calm, “and yes, although no corpse was found, there are also no signs of her being alive. It would be foolish to raise our hopes up for nothing.”
	</p>
	<p>Tsahn grabbed Aurelius’ shoulder. “Careful with your tone,” he whispered in his ear.
	</p>
	<p>“But are you hearing her?” Aurelius whispered back, tone low, “the kid’s acting as if this is all a scheme on Cadi’s part.”
	</p>
	<p>“She is but a kid, after all,” Tsahn said under his breath, as he pulled Aurelius to the side, “Aestas’ heart is more fragile than she behaves to be. And be aware that she is just in despair at the moment. Cadenty was— is—  her sister, for goodness sake.” 
	</p>
	<p>Aestas glared at the older boys one last time through teary eyes, before dashing out the door. 
	</p>
	<p>“You sure know the best time to pick up a fight,” Akti scorned, and raced after the girl.
	</p>
	<p>Uncomfortable silence settled in the sitting room. 
	</p>
	<p>“You just had to—” Tsahn hissed.
	</p>
	<p>“Shouldn’t you be going after them?” Aurelius hissed back.
	</p>
	<p>Tsahn shook his head and let go of Aurelius, stumbled to the side and collapsed on the edge of the long couch. “It’ll only vex her,” he sighed.
	</p>
	<p>The remaining lads sat far apart in mental exhaustion.
	</p>
	<p>“Aestas is right, you know,” Tsahn murmured, staring up at the totems painted on the ceiling. “We shouldn’t give up all hope just yet.”
	</p>
	<p>No response.
	</p>
	<p>“There is still a chance that she’s out there, right?”
	</p>
	<p>Still nothing.
	</p>
	<p>The grayish blue ink seemed to quiver and blur up. Tsahn closed his eyes. “Aurie?” he whispered.
	</p>
	<p>A low hum finally acknowledged his call.
	</p>
	<p>“What do we do now?” he murmured, feeling genuinely lost.
	</p>
	<p>“I don’t know,” Aurelius rasped, tone much softer, as he covered his eyes with one hand. “I just— I really don’t know.”
	</p>
	<p class="p">
	</p>
	<p>Aestas gasped for air. She had to get away from the citadel, away from the noises, and away from everything that she thought she had known of. 
	</p>
	<p>“Stop following me!” she cried over her shoulder at Akti, whose face was swarmed with leaves. 
	</p>
	<p>“Please!” Akti tried. He winced as a sudden harsh force swung past, the leaves and twigs cutting his skin. The raging wind and bright light was making him fear that Aestas might be about to lose control. Just as he was contemplating whether or not to use his powers to bind her, everything stopped. In the next few seconds, an abrupt silence fell over the forest. Akti lowered his arms and saw that the girl had collapsed on the floor. 
	</p>
	<p>“Aestas!” Akti ran. 
	</p>
	<p>“Are you hurt?” he asked anxiously, kneeling down next to her. Worry spilled out of his deep orange eyes as he hurried to help her up. The usual light in Aestas’ lime green orbs was gone as she sat there stunned. 
	</p>
	<p>“Leave me alone,” she murmured. She had tripped over a root and fell face down, cutting her lip on a rock in the process. Her knees and palms stung.
	</p>
	<p>“I’m here,” Akti said instead. He picked up the short sword that had been flung out a few steps ahead, and slipped it back into the leather sheath that hung to Aestas’ waist.
	</p>
	<p>“You’ll be alright,” he murmured, as he swiped his fingers softly over the blood stained chin. “It looks bad,” he frowned, “let’s get you back to the citadel to get that looked at.”
	</p>
	<p>He stopped, however, and looked down— Aestas had grabbed onto his cloak and had said something.
	</p>
	<p>Akti leaned in closer, not having caught her words. “What was that?” he whispered gently.
	</p>
	<p>“<i>My fault</i>—” she started again. “It’s my fault she disappeared.”
	</p>
	<p>“Whatever are you saying?” he asked, “ none of this could’ve been your fault.”
	</p>
	<p>Aestas let out a shaky breath. “No, Akti. You don’t understand—”
	</p>
	<p>She clung to him. “My sister was trying to protect me that day.”
	</p>
	<p>Waves of guilt came washing over her upon the sudden confession. 
	</p>
	<p>“Because of the way I behaved for the past year, Candentia could not trust me enough just to ask me to cooperate. She wouldn’t have had to act by herself if I had been more agreeable. It’s my fault she died.” 
	</p>
	<p>“Don’t say that,” Akti said, “that’s nonsense! And it’s too soon to— you know— just yet. We never know.”
	</p>
	<p>Aestas shook her head. “It’s just as your brother said. It would be foolish to keep our hopes up for nothing.” 
	</p>
	<p>“Don’t you listen to those words,” Akti said, placing his hands on her shoulders, “it came out wrong, of what my brother spoke.”
	</p>
	<p>“He was just speaking the truth.”
	</p>
	<p>“And I—” she went on, finally speaking of her fear, “although they didn’t blame me just yet, I feel like Tsahn and your brother would never forgive me for my part.”
	</p>
	<p>Akti shook his head frantically and held tight to the girl, it felt like she was slipping away, drowning in guilt and sorrow. 
	</p>
	<p>“Please,” he rasped, “don’t ever think that. It was never your fault. Please! Aestas, you have to get that through your mind.”
	</p>
	<p>“And I know I can’t speak for them,” he went on, holding solid eye contact, “but I believe that they are also aware that it was indeed a misjudgment on Candentia’s part, not yours! I’m sure that she wouldn’t have done it if she had known that things would turn out like this.”
	</p>
	<p>“Oh, but she would—” Aestas let out a mirthless laugh. “Anything for the sister who didn’t know better, isn’t that right?”
	</p>
	<p>Akti bit his tongue. <i>No</i>, he wanted to protest.
	</p>
	<p>“And the things I said—” Aestas cried, “oh— Akti, how I wish I could take them back.”
	</p>
	<p>“You never intended any harm,” he replied softly, “nor did you actually cause any.”
	</p>
	<p>Aestas sniffled. Although Akti never talked much, he always knew the right thing to say.
	</p>
	<p>“It’s just a nightmare, right?” she croaked, “tell me it’s just a dream.”
	</p>
	<p>Leaves of crimson red and flaming orange fluttered down, as gentle brushes of the autumn breeze stroked the tree tops. Several squirrels ran by, and scrambled up the trunks, dropping chestnuts into the hollow tree holes of their winter storage. One of the small creatures stopped in its tracks, tilting its head at the strange sound below; others fled the scene, wary of possible intruders. 
	</p>
	<p>The auburn haired lad, who had been kneeling for quite some time, brushed the leaves off of the young heir of Hyacinth’s hair and shoulders. Akti Solicas let out a helpless sigh as he listened with sorrow at the heartbroken wails of Aestas Hyacinth. He understood perfectly well that there was nothing he could do to make her feel better. With a heavy heart, he reached out, hugging the trembling girl gently as he whispered against her hair— 
	</p>
	<p class="pend"> “I truly am sorry.”
