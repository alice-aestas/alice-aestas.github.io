	<h2 class="chapter title">Sweet dreams and Nightmares</h2>

<div class="chaptercontent">
	<p><b class="b">T</b>sahn Aouthyerhl woke up in a sweat. He was lying on his side and breathing hard, hands clutching the sheets. It took him a minute to realize where he was— not the ballroom he dreamt he was in, nor his room at the Nix, but a dorm room on the fifth floor of the royal enchanters department. The thundering of his heart, beating against his eardrum, gradually quieted down, and the sound of even breathing, and snoring, of some other trainees made their way into his ears. 
	</p>
	<p>Tsahn climbed down from the upper bunk he shared with five other trainees and slipped out of the dorm room after changing into his uniform. For the winter program, there are twelve dorm rooms for the boys and eight for the girls, each room shared by ten people, with five sleeping on one lower bunk and five on the upper. 
	</p>
	<p>Tsahn headed straight down stairs to the combined training center, which is located on the first basement, where they usually had their training lessons—the underground training centers and storage rooms occupied the three floors of massive basements spread under the hill, and were shared by the three R.A. departments. 
	</p>
	<p>Tsahn held the band on his wrist to the clear stone, which was embedded on the door of the Enchanter department entrance to the first basement.
	</p>
	<p>A red glow appeared— “access denied,” it indicated.
	</p>
	<p>Tsahn sighed. He remembered just now that the instructors had already informed them that all training grounds were to be closed after the primary trainees’ curfew, and access would be restricted to only senior trainees and official members of the R.A. You can’t blame Tsahn for forgetting though, for being a special diplomatic hostage that trained with the Hyacinth heirs, he used to have free access to most of the training rooms; but now that he has joined the winter training program as a primary trainee, the band on his wrist had been changed into the same level as his peers. Ironic.  
	</p>
	<p>Tsahn groaned softly in frustration. He still needed to cool his mind from the nightmare he was having. Therefore, instead of returning to the dorm room, he headed to the space outside of the department on the first floor, on the side of the hill. It was a half enclosed space surrounded by a four-storied stone wall that had a tall doorway and multiple squares hollowed out— a perfect place for him to set off steam without having to sneak out of the department grounds.
	</p>
	<p>He set a dim light on the side with a simple spell and started practicing the combat sequence he learned the day before.
	</p>
	<p> It was the first week into the winter program for new young trainees who had proven to have potential of joining the R.A., and Tsahn, after careful consideration, had decided to join the tryouts, and eventually got selected. Among the eight hundred people that applied to the program, only two hundred got in after multiple tests, which Tsahn managed to finish all with flying colors.
	</p>
	<p>The winter program— a primary training program for new trainees— lasts for twenty eight days, and when the students are qualified enough, they would further undergo at least two years of advanced training in different Hyacinthous training centers that are located in the four other continents. And finally, every year, in the beginning of summer and the winter, respectively, under twenty individuals would be selected out from each training center to return to Land Hyacinthous for a one year program of ultimate training before becoming an official member of the R.A., and the ones that don’t make it into the three official teams (the R.W.D, the R.S.D., and the R.E.D.) will end up leaving the training centers for other occupations, or become an employee under the Hyacinth family as official staff, such as palace guards, administration staff, trading staff, etc. Most people had to undergo multiple years of training, some persisted even over a decade, just to join the official team. Only the extremely talented were to graduate within five years. Fae Baykartte, Brontes Laers, Ivian Lena, Esen Ventus, and Trina Krelnein were said to be the examples of brilliant trainees who succeeded in finishing the whole training program within the least amount of time, and joined the official R.A. at a young age. And Tsahn wondered if he could do the same.
	</p>
	<p class="p">It was the recess between hand-to-hand combat training, and Tsahn was sitting amongst some new friends he made during the week. They were in friendly chatter, and took turns sharing how they ended up in the program. 
	</p>
	<p>“Hey, yo! Southern boy!” a deep voice called, causing Tshan to look up. 
	</p>
	<p>“Southern boy” was what some of the others called him, a name which he felt somewhat uncomfortable with. 
	</p>
	<p>“Kye,” Tsahn greeted stiffly. 
	</p>
	<p>Kye Anek is one of his roommates; in fact, he’s the one who’s sleeping spot was assigned to the right of Tsahn, on the upper bunk of their dorm room— the sleeping spots were assigned according to the first letter of their last names. He has short hay-colored hair, dark yellow eyes, tan skin, and is a bit shorter than Tsahn, but evidently more bulk with muscles. From the start of the program, Kye had either acted somewhat of a prick to Tsahn, or ignored him completely, despite Tsahn’s attempt of being friendly in the beginning.
	</p>
	<p>“Looks like you didn’t sleep much,” Kye snickered, “having overwhelming dreams?”
	</p>
	<p>“...” Tsahn remained silent.
	</p>
	<p>“You woke me up, you know? With your whining and moaning. What kind of lewd dream were you having? Huh?”
	</p>
	<p>“...what <i>did</i> you just say?” Tsahn blinked slowly.
	</p>
	<p>“Oh, did you forget?” Kye smirked, “or do I have to remind you now in front of your friends.”
	</p>
	<p><i>“‘Candentia?’ ‘Aurelius?’”</i> he moaned. “You were calling out their names so desperately.”
	</p>
	<p>Tsahn’s face turned red. He did not remember speaking in his sleep, but he must’ve let it slip past his mouth, and loud enough for Kye to hear.
	</p>
	<p>“That was a nightmare I was having, thank you very much,” Tsahn said calmly, “so get that dirty image out of your mind.”
	</p>
	<p>“Was it really?” Kye sneered, “because I suddenly recall that Candentia is the name of your future fiance, isn’t it? Weren’t you and the princess supposed to get married, huh? Southern boy?”
	</p>
	<p>At this, Tsahn stood up and clenched his fists.
	</p>
	<p>“Oh, right. I’m sorry,” Kye Anek continued with a smirk after seeing Tsahn’s red face turn pale, <i>“‘was’</i> your fiance. Now that she’s gone, your perfect future of marrying to the throne is also gone, isn’t it? Is that why you’re here with us in the basement of the training centers? And not in the main castle surrounded by luxurious treatments?”
	</p>
	<p>“Watch your mouth, Anek,” Tsahn warned, keeping his voice stern but gentle. He didn’t want to cause any trouble, especially not so early on into the program.
	</p>
	<p>“Or what else?” Kye deadpanned.
	</p>
	<p>“Wake up, Aouthyerhl, your special family background may have gotten you into this program, but from now on, you’re on your own, and I bet it’s only a matter of time till you be crying that you wanna go home.”
	</p>
	<p>It seemed like he was trying to infuriate Tsahn into a fight, but Tsahn, however, wasn’t the type to get himself into one. As we know, he usually slithered out of conflicts as smoothly as a snake.
	</p>
	<p>“That’s actually untrue, so please stop with these false accusations,” Tsahn held his calm, “and we might be able to get through this program together.”
	</p>
	<p>“Yeah,” one of the girls in the circle said to Kye, “keep talking and you’ll get yourself into trouble.”
	</p>
	<p>“What? As if his <i>‘Candentia’</i> were still here? Ha!” he laughed as he stepped forward and grabbed Tsahn by the collar, “who’s to defend your weak ass now?”
	</p>
	<p>“That’s enough,” a low growl sounded before Tsahn could even consider losing his cool.
	</p>
	<p>A few heads turned, including Kye and Tsahn.
	</p>
	<p>The boy that was leaning with his back against the wall on another side of the room had come over, scrunching the water bottle in his hand in the process. 
	</p>
	<p>Kye pushed Tsahn away and held both his hands up in the air, palms facing forward.
	</p>
	<p>“Solicas,” he said, as he stepped a few steps back.
	</p>
	<p>He didn’t expect the general’s first son to come over, let alone speak up. To be honest, the raven-haired boy acted so indifferent and talked so little that Kye often forgot that he was also training with them. When he first heard that the general’s son will be joining the winter program, he had mixed feelings, as did a lot of the other trainees. Some were curious of what the boy would be like, some were reluctant to train with the son of a potential future boss; some thought this to be an opportunity to befriend the boy and do some social climbing; a lot of them were actually afraid of him, as it was said that his skills in combat and enchantment casting were already deadly enough for him to join the advanced training program. 
	</p>
	<p>No matter what the rumors and speculations were, the son of the general turned out to be quite aloof and serious. It didn’t go unnoticed, though, that the twenty one year old is one handsome-looking lad. It was almost a week into the program and almost everyone recognized him, although the only people seen that he initiated conversations with were the instructors and some of his fellow roommates. “<i>The golden boy—</i> Aurelius,” is what they called him.
	</p>
	<p>This was the first time Kye saw the general’s son up close, as they were normally assigned to different groups, and at this moment, he could understand why the boy was praised to be attractive. A strand of his raven-black hair fell across his eyes as he strode forward with a glare— even from the male point of view, one could say that the young lad was a treat to the eye. The dangerous glint of the amber eyes, however, made Kye shiver involuntarily with a sense of fear. 
	</p>
	<p>As Aurelius Solicas stepped closer, Kye Anek thought he was about to get punched in the face by the general’s son. But to his surprise, the raven-haired boy seemed to be only passing by. However, before Kye could let out a sigh of relief, Aurelius Solicas had already put his right hand on Kye’s left shoulder and leaned in close. Kye noticed that the boy was about the same height as Tsahn Aouthyerhl, maybe even taller.
	</p>
	<p>“Keep her name out of your filthy mouth, and your dirty hands off of him,” Aurelius Solicas growled slowly in Kye’s ear.
	</p>
	<p>Kye winced as Aurelius tightened his grip. And before he could answer, Aurelius had already walked away— to the trash can in the other corner, and threw the scrunched-up bottle in the bin.
	</p>
	<p>Kye Anek never once saw Aurelius Solicas and Tsahn Aouthyerhl interact with one another, so he had assumed that the two were unacquainted, despite he did hear some rumors that the general’s son was actually a close friend of the first princess of Hyacinth along with the Syarchia prince. He didn’t believe it until this moment.
	</p>
	<p><i>“Ah,”</i> he said under his breath, as he eyed Tsahn sideways, “so the <i>‘Aurelius’</i> you were calling in your sleep was ‘Aurelius Solicas?’”
	</p>
	<p>The expression on Tsahn’s face was indecipherable;  he merely stared blankly at Kye for a moment and turned away.
	</p>
	<p class="p">Tsahn was silent for the rest of the combat training that morning, and only spoke a little during the lunch period. He was actually quite disturbed by the incident that happened with Kye Anek and Aurelius that morning. 
	</p>
	<p>Apart from his foreign identity, he couldn’t think of another reason why Kye Anek was being such a jerk to him, not that he cared, to be honest. The main culprit that pushed him deep into thought was actually Aurelius Solicas, who had stood up for him unexpectedly. It had been a while since the two spoke. 
	</p>
	<p>Tsahn recalled that the last time he had seen Aurelius around was almost one season ago— the day when he screamed at Aurelius to get out of the Nix and never show his face again. He didn’t really mean it, though, for he <i>was</i> extremely glad that Aurelius was there for him and Aestas when it felt like his world was in the gutter. 
	</p>
	<p>Things turned sideways, however, and the tension between them finally broke, resulting in Tsahn throwing a dagger at the raven-haired boy, who dodged it of course, and stormed out without looking back. 
	</p>
	<p>Tsahn had thought with naivety that Aurelius would come back the next day, which he never did, and after days of waiting, Tsahn gradually accepted that the raven-haired boy might just never come back again. He started having nightmares ever since.
	</p>
	<p>“Does that mean you finally forgave me?” Tsahn murmured to himself.
	</p>
	<p>He had spotted Aurelius on the first day of training, but had refrained himself from calling out to the other. He rarely ever got into any sort of conflicts with others, and with someone as important as Aurelius to him— Tsahn, for the first time, didn’t know what to do; he therefore chose to avoid the problem, and observe the situation from afar in the meantime. 
	</p>
	<p class="p">“Tsahn.” 
	</p>
	<p>His seat buddy nudged him. <i>“The teacher’s calling you,”</i> the boy mouthed.
	</p>
	<p>Tsahn looked up. Heads were turned, and several pairs of curious eyes were trained on him.
	</p>
	<p>They were in one of the large classrooms in the enchanters department building, with all the students of the winter program here— for enchantment combat class. 
	</p>
	<p>The teacher—professor Coulnaur, a slender looking man who looked about thirty to forty years old, along with two other students— a boy and a girl, stood on the platform in the front of the class. They were all looking up at him. Tsahn sucked in a breath when he realized that one of the two students who stood in front of the tall whiteboard, a smirk evidently showing on his face— is Kye Anek.
	</p>
	<p>“Tsahn Aouthyehrl, please come over,” professor Coulnaur repeated, pushing the bridge of his glasses.
	</p>
	<p>Tsahn’s heart filled with dread as he got up and made his way slowly down the steps, to the front of the large classroom. Even though he was drifting off, he could guess what lay before him.
	</p>
	<p>“Can you tell us what we were just learning about?” professor Coulnaur asked.
	</p>
	<p>“Dream extracting,” Tsahn replied without hesitation.
	</p>
	<p><i>“Oi,”</i> the teacher approved, “and how does one perform the enchantment? Tsahn, you are to try it on our Kye here,” and with a snap of the hand, the curtains of the classroom were closed and the shining crystals turned dim.
	</p>
	<p>Even before the class, Tsahn had learned the steps of the spell. So, performing the spell wasn’t the challenging part for him. He nodded and turned to Kye.
	</p>
	<p>“Whenever you’re ready,” he spoke coldly.
	</p>
	<p>Kye shrugged and climbed onto the long bench that the teacher had prepared, “go ahead,” he said, lying down and closing his eyes.
	</p>
	<p>Professor Coulnaur watched closely as Tsahn strapped the other to the bench, making sure that the boy wouldn’t fall off during the spell. Tsahn then pulled out the stone that hung from the black string around his neck. It glowed dimly in his hand before he let it fall in front of his chest.
	</p>
	<p>With different movements of both hands, he weaved a spell in the air above the other’s head, while murmuring the words of the enchantment. And soon enough, the image of dream fragments came spinning to life around them. The other trainees gasped as figures made of glowing smoke rushed past and swirled in the air.
	</p>
	<p>“Now, try to control it so that we can see a story,” the professor said to Tsahn, his ivory hair reflecting the colors of the radiant light.
	</p>
	<p>Tsahn nodded without saying a word. The stone in front of his chest glowed bright, as well as the jewel in his earring— he closed his eyes and focused on weaving a condenser spell.
	</p>
	<p>“Woah,” someone exclaimed.
	</p>
	<p>A soft wave of whispers rippled through the classroom.
	</p>
	<p>“That’s about it,” professor Coulnaur placed a hand on Tsahn’s shoulder. 
	</p>
	<p>Tshan opened his eyes. The colorful dream fragments that were swirling around the classroom were now weaved together in a large sphere above Kye’s head.
	</p>
	<p>“Excellent job,” the professor nodded at Tsahn.
	</p>
	<p>“And now that the hard job is done, the next step is to choose what information we want to get out of the subject.”
	</p>
	<p>“As dreams are said to be our subconsciousness— where our deepest memories alongside wild thoughts are hidden, when we extract the dreams of the subject, we can learn all about them, maybe even more than they will ever know themselves. From their deepest secrets to their darkest fears, an extracting enchantment can tell us that much.”
	</p>
	<p>“This art can be useful in many ways, for example, during war, extracting the dreams of the hostages can tell us many secrets about the enemy; while extracting the dreams of people who lost their brain function can revive some of their memories.”
	</p>
	<p>“The most challenging part of this particular enchantment is to weave a constantly suitable spell to adapt to the changing of dreams, while the other assisting enchanters cast the spell to choose which type of dream you are to see. So our Tsahn here would do the best he can to maintain the shape of Kye’s dream while our Hena here will do the choosing,” the teacher’s finger moved from Tsahn to the other girl on the platform with a graceful wave.
	</p>
	<p>“We will only be trying the two most simple charms today, and move to more complicated ones in future classes. Does anyone know what the most simple charms of dream-extraction are?”
	</p>
	<p>A girl who sat in the front row shot up her hand— she had short, frilly blond hair and apple green eyes. Tsahn recognized her as one of the summer-type trainees.
	</p>
	<p>“Yes, Miss Desill?” the professor called on her.
	</p>
	<p>“Sweet Dreams and nightmares,” she said confidently— her voice sounding like tiny silver bells.
	</p>
	<p><b><i>“Absolutely</i></b> correct,” the professor smiled at her, to which she beamed back, two small pointy teeth showing.
	</p>
	<p>“Good and bad, just like black and white— the two simplest types of dreams there are. If you can put the dreams into either category, the nature of the dream should be strong and simple. But most often, as most things are, dreams cannot be distributed into either category, and instead, will spread out as various types in the broad spectrum— those are hard to define, and will not be our focus today,” professor Coulnaur turned to the girl named Hana Tannor, who waited patiently for her turn to cast the spell.
	</p>
	<p>“Miss Tannor, now’s your turn. Nice dreams first, go on.”
	</p>
	<p>Hena murmured a spell and poked her finger into the shimmering colors of dreams floating above Kye.
	</p>
	<p>The large sphere of smoke seemed to shrink slightly at the stimulation, then it spread out suddenly into a large screen-like figure. Clear images of people moving could be seen, and the sound of laughter could be heard.
	</p>
	<p>The class watched in awe as the image of the bright blue sky and vast ocean came into view. The sight was through Kye’s point of view, and he was dreaming about speeding on the ocean waves with his family.
	</p>
	<p>“Look at you, little one!” the man in the dream ruffled Kye’s hair. He seemed to be Kye’s father.
	</p>
	<p>The smoke of the screen shimmered with a golden glow, indicating that Kye was happy. Tsahn watched the images of the family sailing the boat together and enjoying the waves— they seemed delighted. He smiled a tiny smile. Who would’ve known that such a prick could have such a pure and wholesome dream? 
	</p>
	<p>“Such a beautiful moment, isn’t it?” Professor Coulnaur smiled, his glasses reflecting the blue, silver light, “I’m glad that our Kye here still has dreams that can be put into this category.”
	</p>
	<p>The class chuckled.
	</p>
	<p>“Well, all good things must come to an end. And here we are— about to send our poor Kye here into a bit of a torture, I’m afraid,” professor Coulnaur pushed his glasses again, “Tsahn, be prepared to change the weaving according to the shape of the dreams. Hena, nasty ones, please.” 
	</p>
	<p>And with another murmur of a new spell and a poke to the screen, the dream fragments swirled wildly. 
	</p>
	<p>“Tshan, focus,” professor Coulnaur warned.
	</p>
	<p>Tsahn— sweat dripping down his forehead— tried his best to contain the untamable waves of dark smoke. He closed his eyes again and focused on the spell— the stone that hung in front of his chest glowed brighter, and the smoke seemed to have gradually calmed down, although the sound of waves and thunder crashing loudly still flooded the classroom. Tsahn thought he had failed to control the dream fragments, but then he felt his professor’s hand on his shoulder again.
	</p>
	<p>“That’s about right,” professor Coulnaur said softly.
	</p>
	<p>Tsahn opened his eyes, and to his horror, he, along with the whole classroom, were witnessing a shipwreck that happened in Kye’s dreams. The said boy was stirring in his sleep, and his eyebrows were furrowed.
	</p>
	<p>“Where are you guys going?” Kye’s childish voice sounded. He seemed to be only six or seven years old in the dream.
	</p>
	<p>“We’re going to another continent, my dear,” his mother said.
	</p>
	<p> “Where is that?” Kye asked.
	</p>
	<p>“In the south. Overseas. We’re going to the famous southern lands for trade,” his father’s voice sounded.
	</p>
	<p>Tsahn, hearing this, spaced out a little. The southern land? A shipwreck? This feels bad.
	</p>
	<p>“Tsahn,” professor Coulnaur’s voice brought him back to his senses.
	</p>
	<p>The storm in Kye’s nightmare had come to a point where it was raging so violently and Tsahn had to make strenuous efforts to keep it contained. 
	</p>
	<p>“Father—! Mother—!” the little child— Kye, screamed at the top of his lungs. And all Tsahn and the other students could see was a ship being slowly devoured by the enormous black waves.  
	</p>
	<p>“Where are you?” little Kye screeched at the stormy seas. No ship could be seen on the surface anymore.
	</p>
	<p>“Come back,” he sobbed violently, “come back…”
	</p>
	<p class="p">“Time to put him at ease, Hena,” professor Coulnaur said, and Hena stepped forward and poked the raging dream one last time— her hand was quivering. Kye’s nightmare calmed down, and the dream fragments floated peacefully over his head. Tsahn murmured the spell that returned the dream fragments to Kye, and he sighed with relief when the colorful sphere of smoke was no longer there. 
	</p>
	<p>With a flick of his hand and a murmur of a spell, professor Coulnaur woke the sleeping boy up. Kye looked as if on the verge of tears, having just had his trauma revealed in front of two hundred others. He <i>did</i> volunteer to be the first subject, but it was so that he could choose the other— and he wanted the southern boy’s dreams to be out in the open. 
	</p>
	<p>Even with both hands put together, it wouldn’t be enough fingers for him to count the reasons why he detested the Syarchia prince. 
	</p>
	<p>First of all, the boy with pale brown hair was from the land he despised the most— a land his parent never made it to, and had sacrificed their lives on the way; then there’s the boy being the first son of the powerful clan Syarchia— an identity that surely made his life a living paradise; the southern boy was even said to be the future husband of the first heir of Kye’s own land, back when the girl was still alive, that is. Kye doubted that the boy ever knew such things as hard work and agony. He was also unconvinced that a boy with a foreign lineage could manage passing the tests of the R.A. program without any help from the superiors. 
	</p>
	<p>There’s also his charming and eye-catching features that made the boy popular among the other trainees, and Kye found it annoying. Tsahn Aouthyerhl has this innocent look when his yellow hazel eyes opened wide when he listened intently at whoever was talking, but he also has an alluring charm whenever he glanced sideways through slanting eyes, plunging deep in thought. And although the southern boy holds a unique imposing manner that resembles a hawk, which frightened some others, he was known to be quite calm and friendly, and people often flocked around the hazel-eyed lad without him even trying. 
	</p>
	<p>Everything about the boy irritated Kye. And to make matters worse, they were assigned alongside each other in the same dorm; he sometimes woke up to Tsahn murmuring in his sleep— Kye wanted to expose the boy’s dream in front of all the other students, just to give the other a taste of embarrassment. 
	</p>
	<p>And now his own trauma was exposed in front of his peers, he blamed Tsahn, who performed the extracting spell; although Kye Anek did bring this one on himself.
	</p>
	<p>“Are you alright?” Tsahn asked softly, offering Kye a hand. The dark yellow eyes seemed dazed.
	</p>
	<p>“Don’t need your help,” Kye said, as he came back to his senses. He brushed away Tsahn’s extended hand.
	</p>
	<p>“Your turn,” he snickered after standing back up, “ready to expose your fantasies to the world? Hmm? Southern boy?”
	</p>
	<p><i>Jerk.</i> Tsahn clenched his jaw. 
	</p>
	<p> It wasn’t like he could back out of this situation without having to pull the card of his identity— which he knew the other was expecting him to do. He had no way out. He glanced at Aurelius, who was observing from one of the middle rows of the large classroom, his chin resting on his left palm. The raven-head was toying with the stone that hung on the black string around his neck, slender fingers twirling indifferently as he gazed down at the demonstration in the front of the classroom, meeting Tsahn’s eyes, expression unreadable.
	</p>
	<p>Tsahn’s stomach did a flip and he turned away hastily. He then climbed onto the same bench that Kye had laid on earlier, copied his classmate’s previous position, and closed his eyes. He felt a pair of strong hands tug the straps that wrapped around him, purposely making it a little too tight. Tsahn grunted and took a deep breath— he’ll let it go this time. It’s better to just get this over with.
	</p>
	
	<p class="pend"> And under professor Coulnaur’s instructions, Kye Anek started weaving the spell, and Tsahn gradually drifted off to a place deep in his memory.
	</p>
