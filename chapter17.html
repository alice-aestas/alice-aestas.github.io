	<h2 class="chapter title">It’s me or nothing</h2>

<div class="chaptercontent">
	<p><b class="b">T</b>he following days weren’t of complete darkness, for there was a dim, cool lantern in the corner of the damp and cold cell. Candentia’s teeth chattered uncontrollably while she held tightly to her knees. Her clothes felt stiff against her limbs. The once elegant mindi gown had been torn, and was filthy— covered in mud and blood.
	</p>
	<p>“You wouldn’t last a season in this cell if you’re already shivering like that in the summer,” Lansher Hellebore said from across the room. His voice, though laced with derision, was weak. Candentia Hyacinth could hardly make out his smug smile in the dim crystal glow of the lantern.
	</p>
	<p>“Are you sure you don’t want to come over here?” Lansher drawled.
	</p>
	<p>“Mind your own business,” Candentia snapped.
	</p>
	<p>“You might as well get used to me,” Lansher smirked, “I’m going to be here as your company for quite a while. Thanks to you.”
	</p>
	<p>Candentia gave a short, mirthless laugh.
	</p>
	<p>“Your incompetence in capturing both targets is the only thing to blame here, dear.”
	</p>
	<p>Lansher let out an annoyed sigh, but said nothing.
	</p>
	<p>“If I had known that your own family was going to get rid of you just because you failed a task, I would’ve offered for you to stay at the citadel with us,” the tone of the girl was unperceivable.
	</p>
	<p>“Stop provoking me,” Lansher said darkly, “aren’t you afraid of what I’m capable of?”
	</p>
	<p>“As if you can hurt me with those cuffs around your wrists,” Candentia held up her own hands, which were cuffed in the same, long shackles as he did. 
	</p>
	<p>“You just love testing my patience, don’t you?” he laughed bitterly, but stayed in the corner. The silver material around their wrists and arms had carvings of enchantment engraved on both the surface and inner linings, acting as suppressors to restrain their powers. And Lansher, still worn out from all the torture of the past days, was unable to squeeze what he had left of his energy, and had nothing he could do to try and break free.
	</p>
	<p>Candentia woke up one day feeling a lot better. Although she was still weak, and her powers suppressed, the past few days had been the most peaceful during her stay at the prison of the Northern castle, and she rested well. 
	</p>
	<p>The regular sessions of torture stopped abruptly almost seven days ago— it was hard to count the days as there was no sunlight, nor daylight, visible within the tall walls of the cylindrical cell. Only by counting the meals could she keep track of time. 
	</p>
	<p>The thin covers fell off of her shoulders as Candentia sat up and yawned. She glanced down beside her— Lansher was still fast asleep, his ivory hair trembled and fell across his sculpted face as he shivered against the cold. 
	</p>
	<p>After days and nights in the cell together, Candentia did become familiar with the Hellebore’s presence and had allowed him to come nearer over the course of time— the young Hellebore prince seemed to hold no intent of taking her life. And after waking up to an unfamiliar warmth snuggled up against her one day, she agreed in silence that they had a better chance to survive this way, for the temperature of the cell seemed to be dropping lower and lower as seasons began to change.
	</p>
	<p>Lansher stirred in his sleep and smacked his lips, the movements extracting a soft laugh from Candentia. 
	</p>
	<p>Despite the devilishness of the boy, he looked rather innocent at the moment, with his long, black lashes slightly fluttering against his face, and thin lips slightly parted. He seemed to have murmured something.
	</p>
	<p>Candentia could barely make out his word as she leaned down with her ear near his moving lips. 
	</p>
	<p>“Cold—”
	</p>
	<p>Cold indeed. 
	</p>
	<p>The Hyacinth was shivering herself as she let out several long breaths, creating small balls of white mist that soon dissipated into the darkness. Her hands trembled as she held them up. Examining her dusty palms under the dim lantern light, she murmured an old spell under her breath. 
	</p>
	<p>Nothing happened.
	</p>
	<p>She wrung her wrists and stretched her arms, before trying again and again, making different alterations to the spell. 
	</p>
	<p class="p">Lansher snuggled closer to the source of warmth as his dream gradually faded away. Having stopped shivering, he was able to relax his muscles for the first time after he came back to the North. He shot open his eyes, however, when he suddenly realized that there was a warm wave of enchantment washing over him. Someone had placed their palms on his neck and shoulder, and it was the warm current coming from the hands that washed the chills away.
	</p>
	<p>“Don’t” he croaked softly, his voice still hoarse from just waking up, “you are wasting your energy.”
	</p>
	<p>The girl with ash-black waves tried to free her hands from his grasp. “I wasn’t doing anything,” she said, avoiding his gaze.
	</p>
	<p>“So you just like to wrap your hands around my throat when I’m asleep?” Lansher let out a low chuckle, but choked when she tightened her grip.
	</p>
	<p>“Mercy,” he gasped, “don’t kill me. You wouldn’t want a dead cellmate, would you?”
	</p>
	<p>After a long silence, with the distant sounds of howls in the background, the plump but dry lips of the girl moved. “No,” she stated, “I would prefer not.”
	</p>
	<p>“Was that something one would consider for that long?” Lansher grumbled as he sat up, one hand rubbing his throat.
	</p>
	<p>The girl let out a small smirk.
	</p>
	<p>“How come you have so much energy today?” Lansher kept on mumbling as he examined his cellmate’s hands and wrists— the power suppressors should still be working fine. And if the girl could perform even the slightest enchantment in her state, she is definitely a powerful being.
	</p>
	<p>“It’s been the best sleep I had since I arrived,” she shrugged, “and you were also shivering in your sleep.” She gave him a skeptical look after taking a moment to steady herself after getting up, heart pounding extra hard to pump her cold blood back up to her head. 
	</p>
	<p>“Aren’t you supposedly used to the Northern cold?” she teased.
	</p>
	<p>Lansher lay back down and smiled, with one arm over his eyes, as sudden waves of bitterness washed over him. He burst out laughing; Candentia was midway through the bucket in the corner, splashing cold water onto her face when he did, and she spun around, startled.
	</p>
	<p>With his eyes hidden, it was hard to tell what emotions he held at the moment, and by merely listening to his dry, yet bright, laughter, it seemed as if it was a mixture of amusement and pain. What she didn’t detect, however, was the regret and anger that he hid well behind the bubbling and near-psychotic chortle.
	</p>
	<p class="p">Despite the rare tranquility, the Hellebore heir got pulled out of the cell later in the day and Candentia was left alone in the darkness yet again. 
	</p>
	<p>Contrary to the last time when she was half unconscious, hanging to the ceiling of the dungeon, she was wide awake at the moment, which made the darkness harder to bear. She walked circles, sat in corners, watched the dim crystal light flicker and played with the shadows, trying hard to distract herself from falling into fear. 
	</p>
	<p>It was not until Lansher’s absence did she realize how dense the darkness of the tall cell was, and how time seemed to be only passing in a pace so slow, that it was almost agonizing to keep still. Ominous echoes of the distant howling and droplets dripping amplified, and her heartbeat thundered her eardrums as she eventually curled into a small ball under the thin covers. 
	</p>
	<p>She was still counting the seconds, trying to even out her rapid breathing, when the clicking of multiple locks being opened sounded from the door. 
	</p>
	<p>A grim face emerged from the darkness, as the light of another lantern came into sight. Candentia had barely sat up to take a good look when a lump of shadow came collapsing through the door. She scrambled backwards, as the sickening smell of burnt flesh plunged past her palms and up her nostrils. 
	</p>
	<p>The person stirred and let out a faint moan. “Run,” he tried to say, “run, Cadi. He’s coming for you, too.”
	</p>
	<p>Candentia’s heart did a flip upon hearing the nickname, but soon recognized that the owner of the voice was in fact her former cellmate. 
	</p>
	<p><i>“Lansher?”</i> she croaked as she crawled over. 
	</p>
	<p>Two strong pairs of hands gripped her away, however, before she could even reach the boy that lay, almost lifelessly, on the ground. 
	</p>
	<p>Candentia was pulled out of the cell the same way Lansher had been, and was dragged through the endless hall, up some narrow stairs and through more corridors. 
	</p>
	<p>A labyrinth, the prison was, and Candentia found it impossible to memorize all the turns in the right order. The guards stopped in their tracks when they arrived at a spacious room of the building. Light crept through the small opening above and slanted into the room, while a thin, circular curtain of water fell, filling the white marbled fountain that sat in the center of the space. 
	</p>
	<p>Everything seemed to be still when Candentia regained her consciousness, only to discover that she was lying face up, with her arms and legs chained tightly to one of the marble tables that lined the inner circle of the curtain of water. Chills ran down her spine as she realized that the statue, looking down at her with white marble eyes, was strikingly similar to the one she had seen, when passing through the gardens, on the way to the prison. 
	</p>
	<p>The chains rattled as she struggled in vain.
	</p>
	<p>A low chuckle rumbled through the grounds, and she watched in horror as shadows loomed behind the thin curtain of water.
	</p>
	<p>“Don’t be afraid,” multiple voices overlapped with one another, singing in a chorus that strayed far from harmony. 
	</p>
	<p>Although her arms and legs were sore from all the straining, she still tried to break past the power-suppressors with all her might.
	</p>
	<p>“Well, well,” the eerie chorus sang, “don’t be so impatient. You’ll get your chance to perform your powers in a minute, if you behave.”
	</p>
	<p>“Who are you?” Candentia asked out loud.
	</p>
	<p><i>“Me?”</i> the chorus wheezed. 
	</p>
	<p>The curtain of water parted as a sharp blade of shadow cut through and swirled above Candentia before landing on top of the platform where the fairy statue stood. The color of purplish-red filled the dead, white, marble eyes, and Candentia let out a tiny gasp of terror, as the statue suddenly towered over her, staring straight into her eyes. <b><i>“You know who I am, little lady.”</i></b>
	</p>
	<p>Candentia squeezed her eyes close, shutting out the intense and chilling stare of the bloodshot eyes.
	</p>
	<p>“You don’t like this?” the white, marble lips moved stiffly as the face of the fairy statue inched closer. It let out a low, maniacal laugh—  “None of the sacrifices did.”
	</p>
	<p>“Oh, but don’t you worry,” a singular voice rumbled as black smoke swarmed out of the statue’s eyes, nostrils, and mouth, gathering into the form of a blurry figure. And soon, a pale and scarred face towered over Candentia. “You’ll be very much alive after this is done.”
	</p>
	<p>“Let me go,” Candnetia said blankly, and started into the red eyes of the other. The demon looked amused as it peered down at the girl, who gazed boldly back with deep gray eyes. It had expected a more drastic reaction.
	</p>
	<p><i>“Gray eyes,”</i> it hummed, running a clawed hand through the long strands of black and silver hair, “same as the little lord of Hellebore.”
	</p>
	<p>“Let me go,” Candentia repeated, “you know that the north would be leveled to the ground if anything happens to me.”
	</p>
	<p>“That’s none of my business,” it replied, walking slowly around the table where its prey had been chained.
	</p>
	<p>“Of course it’s your business,” Candentia smirked lightly, causing the ghost-like figure to stop its movements. “You rely on the people as your source of power. With them gone, how would you live?”
	</p>
	<p>“I don’t ‘live,’ little girl,” it snarled, “I ‘exist.’ And nothing could ever extirpate this being.”
	</p>
	<p>“Yes,” she replied with forged calmness, “you exist and you can’t die, but with powers so weak you would have to muddle in the darkness for centuries, merely lingering about the planet.”
	</p>
	<p>The demons’ red eyes glinted as it smiled, sticky saliva dribbled down its sharp teeth as it did. “Smart one,” it said, “it looks like the little Hellebore prince told you more than you needed to know.”
	</p>
	<p>“It has nothing to do with Lansher,” Candentia tried to sit up, but was still bound by the chains, “it’s not that difficult to come up with this conclusion, you know?”
	</p>
	<p>The demon let out another maniacal laugh and leaned in close. “You’re lucky that I don’t plan on killing you. At least not at this moment,” it said, the hot breath causing Candentia to jerk her head away. 
	</p>
	<p>“Just so you know,” it added, while tightening his grip around the cuffs, making them crack as smoke snaked out, “I wasn’t planning on doing this to either one of you if Lansher Hellebore had successfully taken your little sister to me as well.”
	</p>
	<p>“I heard that you were the one that clouded his senses back at your homeland. Clever girl, you are, I admit. But, it seems that you’re not clever enough to save yourself, hmm?”
	</p>
	<p>Candentia winced as the cuffs around her wrists shattered, the pieces cutting deep into her skin, overlapping with her previous wounds. She sprang into action, however, as soon as she felt her powers resurface, no longer suppressed. The demon pranced back onto the platform of the fountain and laughed wildly, as it pulled bloody arrows made of ice, out from its long limbs. 
	</p>
	<p>“Clever indeed,” it chortled, breaking Candentia’s icy weapons in half, “but still, as I said, not clever enough.”
	</p>
	<p>The chains alighted around Candentia as fire burst from the demon’s hands. She shrieked out as the flames snaked around her forearm, creeping down to the back of her right hand. Pain sunk deep into her skin as the burning agony of her arm surged rapidly by the second. There was also a bizarre sensation of something cold being pulled out of her chest, but the pain was too distracting for her to make notice.
	</p>
	<p>“Consider this your payment for almost ruining my plan,” the demon laughed coldly as the flames in its hands gradually died out. The girl from the centered land lay limply on the marble stand, barely struggling. The demon sucked in a huge breath, satisfied with the tingly and smooth feeling of the new power surging in its veins. 
	</p>
	<p>“Take her back,” it commanded, before transforming back into wisps of black smoke and disappearing into the shadows, swirling gleefully on its way, having had not one, but two feasts, long before its annual hibernation. 
	</p>
	<p>The north was already drenched in dry crimson and gold by the time Candentia Hyacinth saw daylight again. She opened her eyes to an unfamiliar sight and saw that the ceiling was gray— not a vibrant color, but enough to make her squeeze her eyes shut again, overwhelmed by the sensation. 
	</p>
	<p><i>It stings. </i>
	</p>
	<p>She wondered if it was yet another dream, for the soft cushions and drapes of the bed made it seem as if she were floating among the clouds. The room she was in overlooked the broad grasslands and forests outside the walls of the Northern castle. Everything was bathed in a warm tone of autumn as the trees swayed gently against the wind. 
	</p>
	<p>The heavy covers fell off of her shoulders as Candentia tried to maintain her own balance with the support of both wrists. She noticed that she was no longer in her muddy rags, but dressed in a soft, buttoned-up gown. The pure white clothing of the upper part, however, was drenched in sweat and clung to her skin. A smooth strand of white clothing was wrapped with care, around her right hand and up her forearm, where the demon last left its mark. The wound still stung, as if still alight with flames.
	</p>
	<p>“I see that you’re awake,” a voice sounded as a girl with silky, straight burgundy hair entered the room. Candentia recognized by the cold expression of the violet eyes of the visitor, that the girl was the older twin of the Hellebore sisters.
	</p>
	<p>“Where am I?” Candentia croaked, her throat dry. She tugged at the collar of her shirt, for it felt like her body was burning.
	</p>
	<p>“I wouldn’t recommend doing that,” Jashi Hellebore said as she approached the bedside. The feverish skin of the foreigner burned under her cold fingers as she buttoned up the open blouse.
	</p>
	<p>Candentia whined softly, trying to undo her top again, wincing, every muscle aching with her every movement.
	</p>
	<p>“Behave,” Jashi commanded, “or do you want to die of fever in a foreign land?” She pushed the other back down and Candentia felt a cool sensation on her forehead. 
	</p>
	<p>“You seem used to taking care of sick and wounded people,” Candentia commented as she reached up and touched the damp cloth.
	</p>
	<p>Jashi Hellebore didn’t answer, and Candentia Hyacinth sunk back into the cushions, allowing the other to work the way up her wounded arm, tending to the burnt skin in silence. 
	</p>
	<p>Candentia understood, from the conversations exchanged with Lansher Hellebore in the darkness of the prison, that it wasn’t his first experience of the drastic punishment. And from the short stories he shared, she was able to catch a glimpse of the torture and misery the siblings, as well as the people of the North, went through. It was nothing like what she had learned back at Land Hyacinthous, where she was taught that the boundary spell was a historic act that ended the war and saved the other lands from further destruction. 
	</p>
	<p>The great enchantment, although succeeded in trapping the demon in the North, also took away the freedom of the innocent people. And with communications restricted and resources cut short, life was harsh on Northerners, despite the abundance of functionable Northern crystal. Poverty and starvation spread out as the demon sucked the life away from the land, relying on whatever energy was left within the borders.
	</p>
	<p>Was the boundary enchantment a necessary act? Yes, it seemed to be. But did the people deserve such suffering? 
	</p>
	<p>Candentia sighed, feeling yet drowsy from her fever.
	</p>
	<p>Jashi left soon after, and Candentia lay in the silence of the foreign bedroom, plunging deep into thought.
	</p>
	<p>Staring at the newly bandaged arm, Candentia wondered if Lansher was alright. She had refrained herself from asking Jashi, in fear of triggering unwanted emotions from the other. She faintly remembered being thrown back into the cell where Lansher had lay still, with his arm covered in red blisters. Candentia had guessed that he had went through a similar torture as she did, and managed to badge up his arm with a blue shash that she tore from her dress and rinsed in the bucket beforehand.
	</p>
	<p>As she lay in the soft covers, Candentia flicked her wrist and tried to create a dagger made of ice, and sat up when she discovered in despair that she, in fact, could not perform the enchantment. After straining hard, she felt with slight relief that there was indeed a small current of cold magic pushing through her veins, however weakly it pulsed. It’ll get better. She comforted herself.
	</p>
	<p class="p">“Where’s Cadi?” were the first words that came out of Lansher Hellebore’s mouth when he woke up. 
	</p>
	<p>“Lie back down, Lansher,” one of his sisters said coldly, “you’re still burning with fever.”
	</p>
	<p>“The Hyacinth girl is alright,” his other sister said, voice soft, “she’s alive. If that’s what you’re asking.”
	</p>
	<p>“Have you grown soft for the enemy already?” 
	</p>
	<p>“No, Jashi,” Lansher laughed dryly, “of course not.” He then added with a smile, “if anything, I think I managed to gain her trust and win her over with my charm.”
	</p>
	<p>Jashi gave a snort. “Candentia Hyacinth never asked  about you since she woke up,” she told him, “not once. So I would assume that you failed to make progress with the enemy as well.”
	</p>
	<p>“Now, now,” Henitah cut in, “don’t start quarreling. There’s no time to waste. We have a lot to discuss before it’s too late.” She held Lansher’s hand and gazed at him with worried eyes.
	</p>
	<p>“What is it?” Lansher had a bad feeling, for the expression on Jashi’s face was also clouded with darkness. “Am I to die?” he joked, but winced as Henitah squeezed his hands hard.
	</p>
	<p>“Don’t joke about it,” Henitah was on the verge of bursting into tears.
	</p>
	<p>“Sorry,” Lansher murmured. And he glanced at his other sister for an explanation— she shook her head slowly.
	</p>
	<p>“We’re planning on getting you out of here before the autumn harvest,” her voice was low as she leaned in, “the Lord already took your powers, and we fear that it is planning on taking your life before going into its winter hibernation. I overheard Father stressing over it.”
	</p>
	<p>“What about the Hyacinth?” he asked.
	</p>
	<p>“What about her?”
	</p>
	<p>“What should we do about her?” he asked, contemplating the matter, “I’m taking her with me,” he said, before his sisters could answer.
	</p>
	<p>“As a hostage,” Jashi agreed.
	</p>
	<p>Henitah nodded, “with you gone,” she spoke to Lansher, “who knows what the Lord would do to her— and if he takes her life, we would be doomed for sure.” She shivered. “Going to war against Land Hyacinthous is the one thing we should be avoiding.”
	</p>
	<p class="p">“I heard that you had a private conversation with the Hyacinth princess today,” the slim figure with slick black hair and pale skin said to Jashi Hellebore, voice low but thin.
	</p>
	<p>“Yes, my lord,” Jashi said, keeping her eyes cast to the floor. 
	</p>
	<p>“Care to share it with us?” the low voice hissed.
	</p>
	<p>“Candentia Hyacinth came to me with a proposal,” Jashi stated, and glanced up at her father, who sat in the throne before her. The King of the North nodded, urging her to go on.
	</p>
	<p>“She asked if she could be let out of the castle,” Jashi said, “she said that she wanted to see what it was really like in the North, if she were to be kept here for a long period of time.”
	</p>
	<p>“And what did you tell her?” the King asked.
	</p>
	<p>“I told her that it was out of the question,” Jashi replied, “and that it was foolish of her to think that she could have that kind of privilege as a hostage.”
	</p>
	<p>“That’s my girl,” the King praised.
	</p>
	<p>However, the shadow-like figure that stood beside the throne opened its mouth, showing its sharp teeth, and said otherwise— “on another thought—” it said slowly, “it wouldn’t do us any harm for the little lady to roam outdoors. She can’t escape anywhere with her powers gone.” 
	</p>
	<p>It smacked its lips at the thought of the deliciousness of the Hyacinth’s powers. 
	</p>
	<p><i>It craved for more.</i>
	</p>
	<p>“If anything,” it went on, murmuring to itself, “it might actually be good if the both of them go outdoors and gain a healthy body before the harvest.”
	</p>
	<p>Alarms blasted out in Jashi’s mind, but she kept her composure and forged an innocent expression of not understanding a word.
	</p>
	<p>It was true that the Hyacinthous hostage had stared Jashi in the eye, and said, “I have a proposal,” before going silent, refusing to talk before Jashi signaled for the guards to wait outside of the door. But the truth was, Candentia Hyacinth didn’t say anything about wanting to go outdoors, despite the fact that she was indeed bored to the core, confined to the bed-chamber. What the Hyacinth heir said, was in fact, words Jashi Hellebore had not expected.
	</p>
	<p>“Help me escape,” she said bluntly, once they were alone.
	</p>
	<p>“What?” Jashi said with a blank expression.
	</p>
	<p>“There’s so much I need to do,” she said, gazing out the window at the vibrant leaves in the trees, “I want to try and make a difference that can do something with the situation of the North. And being confined to this chamber is of no help.”
	</p>
	<p>Jashi had let out a cold laugh. “Your naivety amazes me,” she said, “did you really think that we would let you go just so you can— in your own words, what is it? Oh, yeah— ‘change the world?’”
	</p>
	<p>“Yeah, that sounded arrogant,” Candentia bit her lip and smiled sheepishly.
	</p>
	<p>“To be honest,” she changed her tone, gently patting her bandaged arm, trying to fight the urge to scratch, “I fear that my powers, as well as your brother’s, have been devoured by that demon of yours. And I have a bad feeling that Lansher and I might not make it out alive if we stay here.”
	</p>
	<p>At this, Jashi jerked slightly, which didn’t go unnoticed by Candentia, who was observing her visitor from the reflection on the window glass.
	</p>
	<p>“With his powers gone,” Candentia stated with brutal honesty, “he is nothing but a piece of disposable meat to the demon, isn’t he?” She smiled when she noticed how Jashi’s hands curled into fists as they trembled— <i>jackpot</i>.
	</p>
	<p>“And in my situation,” she continued in earnest, “it is a hazard for me, as well as your land, that I remain defenseless where a demon might kill me any minute.”
	</p>
	<p>“If that happens—” she took a sidelong glance at Jashi Hellebore.
	</p>
	<p>“We would be at war,” Jashi cut in and took a deep breath, “yeah, I know.”
	</p>
	<p>The Hyacinth girl turned around and smiled. Jashi swore that she could see Lansher’s shadow in Candentia’s movements, for as the girl leaned against the the window with her hands holding on to the wooden frame as support, the smirk, as well as the glint in her dark gray eyes, was of a dangerous determination that Jashi couldn’t be more familiar with.
	</p>
	<p>“I see that you understand,” Candentia Hyacinth said, “I’m glad that we are on the same page.”
	</p>
	<p>“Go on,” Jashi said, “let’s see if that’s true.”
	</p>
	<p>“What I’m proposing is that— you help me escape, and we might save your brother’s life in the process.”
	</p>
	<p>“There’s no such thing as ‘might save,’ but ‘will save,’ dear cousin,” Jashi crossed her arms, looking serious in her business attire, with a smart white shirt tucked into her plum-colored, long, fall pants. “What makes us trust you?” she tilted her head. A strand of silky, burgundy hair slipped from behind her ear.
	</p>
	<p>“We both know that we might just never come to trust each other,” Candentia replied, “but from my part, I’m even willing to play the villain for your sake,” she went on, “for taking Lansher with me, you can claim it as if I took him as a hostage and threatened for you to let me escape; while my people would accuse him the same if word went out that we left the North. And with both sides not being certain of the truth, the lands would reach a stalemate, and that would buy us some time to do whatever we have to do to regain our powers and seek out a way to free the North.”
	</p>
	<p>Jashi Hellebore stared at her distant cousin. The girl resembled a gentle spring morning— her slim, pure white dress, flowed just above her knees, and a short, lilac colored coat covered her shoulders; two locks of her wavy, ashy, black hair was braided loosely to the back of her head, and tied up with a soft purple bow; and the lashes around her doe, gray eyes were darker than ever, while her once dry lips, were now plump and glossy. From merely taking in her doll-like appearance, one would assume that she knew nothing about hardships nor agony, and would think that she also wouldn’t be able to conduct a word or two about war and strategy. Jashi Hellebore hid her thoughts to herself. <i>Never judge a book by its cover.</i> This is the first heir of Hyacinthous after all— supposedly one of the most dangerous young heirs out there. She knew that even if she couldn’t trust Candentia Hyacinth’s intentions, they could rely on her determination for survival, which was the best chance for them in the meantime.
	</p>
	<p>“Very well,” Jashi replied after what felt like a long period of time, “your proposal— I will take it to my siblings, and we will discuss and consider.”
	</p>
	<p>“And another thing,” she turned back to the girl that sat on the window frame, remembering something, “even with you and Lansher gone, I would still do my best at bargaining for our land.”
	</p>
	<p>Candentia tilted her head and waited for Jashi to go on.
	</p>
	<p>“If your king agreed to lift the boundary enchantment on behalf of your life, you have to understand that the North would take the offer without hesitation. Demon or not, for the enchantment to be lifted is our desire, and you should know that. And for our land, the sooner, the better.”
	</p>
	<p>“Of course,” the Hyacinth replied breezily, “that goes without saying, and I understand.”
	</p>
	<p>Born in winter, and arrived in summer— the Hyacinth’s smile under the autumn sky glowed ever so bright, as if a spring flower in full bloom. Jashi Hellebore felt as if the girl were a gust of gentle breeze that came out of nowhere, and swept them up calmly in a graceful dance, in spite of chaos exploding all around.
	</p>
	<p>“Act as if I were here in the North all the time,” she told Jashi, “and do what you have to do. If the spell is lifted, and the demon is unfortunately released, we can still find another way to peace.”
	</p><br>
	<p class="p"><i>“Hey,”</i> Candantia said softly as she gazed into both of her cousin’s eyes, “I’m really sorry.” She didn’t say what she was sorry for, in fact, she couldn’t— there was no way for amends of what they had gone through, what the Northern people had to suffer.
	</p>
	<p>“It’s not your fault,” Henitah replied with a small smile, “just promise you’ll take good care of Lansher.”
	</p>
	<p>“I can take good care of myself, dear sister,” Lansher gave Henitah a gentle kiss on the cheek, “you’ll have to take good care of Jashi here for me.”
	</p>
	<p>Henitah giggled softly and reached up. Lansher bent over and let her ruffle his hair. “Leave it to me,” she said, her violet eyes glossy and full of sorrow.
	</p>
	<p>Jashi, on the other hand, stood stiffly on the side without saying a word. Only when Lansher pulled her into a hug, did she grab the back of his shirt tightly. 
	</p>
	<p>“Take care,” Lansher whispered, and planted a soft kiss on the top of her head. “I’ll see you in no time.” 
	</p>
	<p>It was hard for her to let go.
	</p>
	<p class="p">By the time Lansher and Candentia had reached the port, the violet-eyed twins were already tied up in chairs, their mouths stuffed up with clothes, and were moaning for help in one of the dungeons beneath the castle. It would be some time until someone had found the twins, and realized that the Hyacinth hostage had fled, possibly taking the Hellebore prince with her.
	</p>
	<p>No prediction could tell them of how long the journey might last, or even if they could make it out alive. Chances of them running into danger were high, and it was a risk of thousands of lives. But to turn wrong into right, the first step they could take was to leave without being caught, and find a way to make it to the other shore.
	</p>
	<p>“So this really is the only solution,” Candentia Hyacinth groaned, starting to regret her choices.
	</p>
	<p>Her body was still in pain, and the burnt wound on her arm ached; to think of all the trouble that the gray-eyed lad could possibly cause along the way, only made her headache worse.
	</p>
	<p>The said lad climbed into a wooden cargo box and held out his hand, gray eyes glinting with playfulness as he squinted slightly and laughed— a sound of soft thunder in early spring.
	</p>
	<p>“Yup,” he said, and gave his shoulders a tiny shrug.
	</p>
	<p>A memory of their first encounter resurfaced in his mind. And as Candentia Hyacinth grasped his extended hand and climbed in, Lansher Hellebore gazed at her with a smug smile tugging the side of his lips, the one that she had grown so used to over the two seasons. 
	</p>
	<p>“Yup,” he repeated.
	</p>
	<p class="p"><i>“It’s me or nothing.”</i>
