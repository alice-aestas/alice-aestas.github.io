<div class="chaptercontent">
	<p><b class="b">“T</b>here you are,” a shrill voice echoed through the hall as Aestas Hyacinth stepped into the stone-closed building. 
	</p>
	<p>“I thought we agreed that you came back two hours ago.”
	</p>
	<p>It was her sister, who was on the inner balcony of the second floor, behind the balustrade, arms full with a pile of colorful laces and dresses, her gray-eyes icy. She looked down at Aestas, who stood in the foyer of the Nix residence.
	</p>
	<p>“Relax,” Aestas said in a honeyed voice, <i>“it’s no big deal.” </i>
	</p>
	<p>“No big deal?” Candentia Hyacinth blinked in disbelief. She clutched the clothes tighter to her chest. These were some of the best designs of hers that she had hand picked for Aestas, and had been waiting all afternoon to show the younger. The preparation for the upcoming summer festival certainly was eating up a great amount of time and effort.
	</p>
	<p>Aestas rolled her eyes and waved at the guards that held the door, turning the other ear.
	</p>
	<p>“Hey there,” she greeted them brightly.
	</p>
	<p>“Welcome back,” the guards saluted in response. 
	</p>
	<p>Aestas’ hazel and lime-colored eyes lit up as her gaze landed on the younger of the two. He was a cute looking lad whom Aestas had never seen around the place. She took a step closer and discovered in delight that under his silky strands of blond hair, were eyes of her favourite kind. She laughed happily. 
	</p>
	<p>“You’re new,” Aestas smiled ever so sweetly as she stared up innocently into his forest green eyes. 
	</p>
	<p>He blinked, startled by the sudden intimacy and glanced frantically across at his fellow guard in question. The other, who seemed used to this kind of scenario, simply gave a tiny nod.
