	<h2 class="chaptertitle">The Nix</h2>

<div class="chaptercontent">
	<p><b class="b">“T</b>here you are,” a shrill voice echoed through the hall as Aestas Hyacinth stepped into the stone-closed building. 
	</p>
	<p>“I thought we agreed that you came back two hours ago.”
	</p>
	<p>It was her sister, who was on the inner balcony of the second floor, behind the balustrade, arms full with a pile of colorful laces and dresses, her gray-eyes icy. She looked down at Aestas, who stood in the foyer of the Nix residence.
	</p>
	<p>“Relax,” Aestas said in a honeyed voice, <i>“it’s no big deal.” </i>
	</p>
	<p>“No big deal?” Candentia Hyacinth blinked in disbelief. She clutched the clothes tighter to her chest. These were some of the best designs of hers that she had hand picked for Aestas, and had been waiting all afternoon to show the younger. The preparation for the upcoming summer festival certainly was eating up a great amount of time and effort.
	</p>
	<p>Aestas rolled her eyes and waved at the guards that held the door, turning the other ear.
	</p>
	<p>“Hey there,” she greeted them brightly.
	</p>
	<p>“Welcome back,” the guards saluted in response. 
	</p>
	<p>Aestas’ hazel and lime-colored eyes lit up as her gaze landed on the younger of the two. He was a cute looking lad whom Aestas had never seen around the place. She took a step closer and discovered in delight that under his silky strands of blond hair, were eyes of her favourite kind. She laughed happily. 
	</p>
	<p>“You’re new,” Aestas smiled ever so sweetly as she stared up innocently into his forest green eyes. 
	</p>
	<p>He blinked, startled by the sudden intimacy and glanced frantically across at his fellow guard in question. The other, who seemed used to this kind of scenario, simply gave a tiny nod. 
	</p>
	<p>“Yes ma’am,” the young guard then replied.
	</p>
	<p>“Don’t call me ‘ma’am’,“ Aestas pouted, “that makes me sound old.” 
	</p>
	<p>“Well, then lady Aestas Fleur it is,” he smiled down at her.
	</p>
	<p>“Isn’t it sweet that you know my middle name?” she giggled, as she pushed a strand of gradient soft brown hair behind her right ear.
	</p>
	<p>“Aestas—,” her sister cut in impatiently, still standing there.
	</p>
	<p>Aestas ignored her, leaned towards the young guard and beckoned for his ear, hooded eyes slanting.
	</p>
	<p>His fellow guard shot him a warning look and shook his head.
	</p>
	<p>“Come on,” Aestas coaxed, “I want to ask you something, and it's not like I bite,” — the blond highlights in her hair swayed as she rocked back and forth on her heels.
	</p>
	<p>Though hesitant, the young guard complied and bent down, offering Aestas his right ear.   
	</p>
	<p>Aestas stood on her tippy toes and leaned closer.
	</p>
	<p>“She’s angry again, isn’t she?” she whispered with a smile.
	</p>
	<p>Though she did whisper, she made no effort to keep down the volume. Her soft hiss travelled far enough to reach the second floor, where Candentia stood still. 
	</p>
	<p>The guards hastily returned to an upright position, arms glued to their sides, and eyes to the front, as if staring into the void. 
	</p>
	<p>Aestas huffed. 
	</p>
	<p>She hated how her sister pursed her lips tightly together. “Tsk, all judgy again,” Aestas thought.
	</p>
	<p>“Is it just me or did the temperature just drop several degrees?” she said with a fake laugh.
	</p>
	<p>“Close the doors,” said Candentia simply, her tone ice cold as she turned to Aestas, “and back to you, little sister, may I ask where have you been all afternoon?” 
	</p>
	<p>Aestas ignored her sister’s question and glanced over her shoulder, hoping for a last glimpse of the raging orange of the burning sunset, but the last ray of light quickly slipped away as the heavy marble doors were shut behind her by the guards. The coolness of the spacious hall settled, and Aestas felt trapped again. 
	</p>
	<p>It was summer, which should be no doubt her own season. However, whenever she stepped into the cool shadows of the building she shared with her sister, she felt as if she were pulled back constantly into reality. It was obvious that she could see and think clearer whenever she let herself cool down, but she much preferred the opposite, where her feelings and emotions could float around, without having to bear the weight of life. 
	</p>
	<p>It wasn’t that she disliked the place they called home, but the more she grew up, the more lonely it seemed to be anywhere near the palace, especially around the Nix building where she shared residence with her <i>perfect</i> sister. 
	</p>
	<p class="p">
	</p>
	<p>The Citadel of Annyo, constructed on terraces and the following hills, consists of three parts, the entry part, the main part, and the upper part. The three are separated by altitude and built on different terraces that are connected by gentle green slopes and stone-paved stairs. The entry part is the lowest in altitude and the smallest in area, as most of the land of that terrace is used as a huge square in front of the main castle gate. The main part is in the middle, is the largest in area, and is where the main building is. The main building of the citadel is often called “the main castle,” to avoid confusion. From business to pleasure, most of the citadel’s activities take place here. It is a gigantic building that has a north, an east, and a south wing, with the second being the largest and highest of all. 
	</p>
	<p>When Candentia and Aestas were little kids under the age of ten, they lived in the north wing of the main castle, along with the King and Queen. They had often loved to run from ballroom to ballroom, playing with anything they had come up with at that time, for example, pretending that they were exploring a maze. Happy as they were, it was told to Aestas one day when she was six, that her older sister was going to move out of the main castle and to the Nix resident up on the upper part of the citadel. 
	</p>
	<p>Aestas couldn’t remember clearly the reason her sister left the main castle so suddenly, but something must’ve happened. It was such a long time ago. The only faint memory that Aestas seemed to recall is that Aurelius Solicas— the son of the Erai Solicas, who is the incumbent general of the Royal Swordsmen Department, and Tsahn Aouthyerhl— a southern boy, who had just been sent to Annyo, were both said to be severely hurt, or ill, around that time and the main castle was full of dark glances and whispers. The news that both Candentia and the southern boy, Tsahn, would be moving to the Nix residence, was announced soon after. And Aestas also remembered how her sister seemed to go disturbingly quiet during those days. Not knowing what happened, Aestas had thought that the ten-year old was angry with her.
	</p>
	<p class="p">“Don’t leave me!” Aestas had begged, “Candentia? Did I do something wrong? Why are you moving away?”
	</p>
	<p>“No,” Candentia had said ever so gently, “I wouldn’t leave you for no matter reason. And I’m not moving away, just changing buildings where I sleep, that’s all.”
	</p>
	<p>“Why—?” Aestas has sniffled.
	</p>
	<p>“It’s for the best. So that I don’t hurt anyone again. And because Father and Mother have decided.” It had been a while since Candentia said so many words. Her throat burned.
	</p>
	<p>“No! I don’t want you to go,” Aestas sobbed, “so do you want to go? Can you persuade Mother? I'll go persuade Father.”
	</p>
	<p>“Aestas,” her sister pulled her close and placed a hand on the six-year old’s head. Aestas stopped squirming and buried her face in her sister’s cloak. “Don’t go,” she said, “I’ll be lonely.”
	</p>
	<p>“I'll come see you whenever I can,” her sister whispered, “and you can come find me whenever you want. It’ll be like sleeping in different rooms, just a little farther away.”
	</p>
	<p>Aestas lifted her teary eyes. The lime-green hazel orbs were full of sadness.  
	</p>
	<p>“If you really have to go, can I come, too?”
	</p>
	<p>The ten-year old shook her head slowly and smiled sadly. “I want to be with you all the time, too, Aestas,” she said, “but this time I can't. And you’re still too little to leave the main castle. It'll actually be less lonely for you to stay here with Mother and Father, and I’ll come visit you whenever I can. Plus, you will make a lot of friends when you start the academy this year. You’ll want to play with them then. Oh, that reminds me! We’ll be going to school together then! You’ll see me there, too.”
	</p>
	<p>Aestas shook her head and pouted, “but I don’t want new friends, I want to play with you!” At which Candentia let out a tiny smile and wiped away the tears on the little one’s face.
	</p>
	<p>“You can come find me at school, too,” she coaxed, “how about this, I can come pick you up before school and we can walk down the hill together?”
	</p>
	<p>“Yay! Yes! I would like that. I love you the most!” Aestas hugged her sister, jumping up and down. 
	</p>
	<p>Candentia laughed. A sound that Aestas had missed for so long since the sad news was announced.
	</p>
	<p>Aestas beamed from ear to ear and hugged her sister even more tightly. She always feels happy whenever the older one is happy.
	</p>
	<p>“It’ll be like sleeping in different rooms,” she repeated Candentia’s words over and over, trying to persuade her own little heart that everything would be just as the way it was, “just a little farther away.”
	</p>
	<p class="p">Hell, it wasn’t “just different rooms,” and certainly not “just a little farther away.” It was actually “different parts of the citadel,” for goodness sake. The Nix, the building that Candentia and the southern boy, Tsahn, moved into at the age of ten, is situated on the south side of the upper part of the citadel, along with the three royal army department buildings, and is a relatively small building, when compared to the main castle down on the main part. It is a three storied, white stone, beautiful and bright building with lots of windows. The royal library could be seen right next to it. 
	</p>
	<p>The upper part of the citadel is only ⅕ the size of the main part, but with the utilization of the hills made into three stories of basements, it was enough for the whole three departments of the royal army, along with the royal library, to fit just in. Apart from the building “Nix,” that had three stories, and the library seven, all the other upper-hill buildings were eleven-storied, with only their top three stories on the ground floor of the upper terrace, the lower floors were built either on the side of, or under, the hill. 
	</p>
	<p>Aestas spent most of her childhood days running between the main castle and the Nix residence. Both places played significant parts in her life. And when she was ten, she was given the chance to choose if she wanted to join her sister at the Nix residence, as it turned out the Nix might just be the suitable place to raise the future heirs. 
	</p>
	<p>Originally, the two children— Candentia Hyacinth and  Tsahn Aouthyerhl, were sent to the Nix to be isolated and kept away from the eyes of the numerous people that shuttled back and forth in the main part of the citadel, after an incident at the main castle that terrified the officials. It was decided, after careful consideration, that it was best for everyone that the children stay away. It wasn’t intentional for them to undergo any special training, and was rather a side benefit for living in the same part with the R.A. However, although unexpected, it was to the Hyacinths’ delight that the results of Candentia and Tsahn’s performance in enchantment and combat training turned out to be rather impressive throughout the years of their stay at the Nix. And when Aestas was old enough, she was given the choice of where she preferred to stay. 
	</p>
	<p class="p">Aestas sighed and looked around. The gray marble floors and tall windows made the place seem so cold and gloomy.
	</p>
	<p>Sure, she still loved the Nix where she spent over half of her childhood days in, but she just couldn’t bear the loneliness she often felt these days. As far as she could remember, ringing laughter had always filled up the space of the main hall, often to the brim where it spilled out the windows and drifted off into the night. But recently, with some family issues troubling the heirs, and with the turbulent situation regarding the north deteriorating, the citadel seems more gloomier than ever. It could be her mood swings talking, as puberty started to hit her like a big wave, but with the absence of the laughter, the emptiness of the place seemed to magnify, and the silence amplified.
	</p>
	<p class="p">Aestas walked swiftly up the stairwell, past her sister, up to the third floor, around a corner, then another, and headed towards her room.
	</p>
	<p>“Aestas,” a different voice called from behind. She didn’t have to turn around to know that it was Tsahn Aouthyerhl. A strand of soft pale brown fell across his yellow hazel eyes as he peeked around the door of his bedroom. 
	</p>
	<p>Although Tsahn Aouthyerhl lived on the same floor, in the same building as the heirs, he isn’t actually a member of the Hyacinth family, nor does he have any blood relation with them. He is the first son of the Great Chief Aouthyerhl of Clan Syarchia, and had been sent to Annyo under diplomatic circumstances when he was only ten. Speaking of it bluntly, he is somewhat of a hostage, even though he has been allowed to return to his homeland with the migratory birds every autumn since he turned twelve. And when Aestas joined the Nix residence after her tenth birthday, she immediately took a liking to the gentle and patient stranger who treated her as if she were his own sister.
	</p>
	<p class="p">“Aestas,”
	</p>
	<p>As coaxing as Tsahn’s soft voice was of now, Aestas tensed up when she heard his call. She couldn’t bear it for him to be disappointed in her also.
	</p>
	<p>“What?” she smiled at him stiffly, afraid that the guilt in her heart would show.
	</p>
	<p>“Are you alright? You looked troubled,” he asked soothingly.
	</p>
	<p>“It’s nothing,” Aestas smiled, “I’m perfectly fine.”
	</p>
	<p>“You have that guilty look in your eyes again, little one,” he said, his words debunking Aestas’ emotional shield almost immediately. He gazed into her eyes as he stepped out from behind the tall wooden door of his bedroom— the surface of his door was covered with delicate carvings of birds from his homeland— and he came towards her.
	</p>
	<p>“Did you have an argument with Candentia again?” he asked cautiously, tone soft.
	</p>
	<p>“No, I don’t. No, I didn’t!” her tone came out raised, “and it’s none of your business.”
	</p>
	<p>“You’re right,” Tsahn Aouthyerhl said, his voice calm and his gaze gentle, “It might not be my place to say this, but …,” his voice trailed off as he noticed that tears were welling up in Aestas’ lime hazel eyes. 
	</p>
	<p>“<i>Oh dear</i>,” he thought, and reached out his hand.
	</p>
	<p>Aestas swatted his hand away, “Go ahead! Say it’s my fault,” she glared, “just blame me for everything.”
	</p>
	<p>Tsahn looked troubled.
	</p>
	<p>“That wasn’t what I meant to say!” he protested gently, and continued carefully, “but this rebellious behaviour of yours these days has been a bit of a challenge for the preparation of the upcoming festival. It is your birthday celebration after all.”
	</p>
	<p>Something in Aestas broke. She felt like she wanted to scream and run away. Her problem with Candentia was one thing, but for Tsahn to take her sister's side? It was simply too much for Aestas. Nothing is worse than the feeling of betrayal when you need support the most.
	</p>
	<p>“So is this all my responsibility now?! Am I the one to blame? Is that it?” she cried. The tears that watered her eyes were now hopelessly rolling down her cheeks, “Candentia’s giving me such a hard time I don’t think I can take it anymore.”
	</p>
	<p>Aestas tears were hot and full of guilt, self loathe, anger, and resentment. She felt like a mess. 
	</p>
	<p>Tsahn Aouthyerhl looked worried.
	</p>
	<p>“I don’t think Candentia meant to give you any discomfort. She just wants this celebration to be perfect for you. I’ll talk to her and see what I can do.”
	</p>
	<p>“But you didn’t see her face when I came in, Tsahn,” Aestas sniffled, “although she didn’t say much, but I can tell that she was so mad. And her tone, Tsahn…, it was so so cold…”
	</p>
	<p>She lifted her teary face, hoping to see a reaction from the older.
	</p>
	<p>Tsahn smiled in pain as he reached out and placed his hand on her head. He had unconsciously taken up Candentia’s habit of placing a hand on Aestas’ head to comfort her.
	</p>
	<p>“Cadenty—, your sister, I mean— I can promise you that she really means no harm. You know her, she’s just like that sometimes, cold and unresponsive, especially when she’s under pressure,” he said in his soothing voice. “She’s actually having a rather hard time dealing with this festival this year. It’s your sweet sixteen, after all, and she’s in charge of making the arrangements of the R.A. announcement ceremony. Wow, you are going to perform your first task as an official heir that day. Time really flies.”
	</p>
	<p>No, this wasn’t what she wanted to hear. Aestas pushed Tsahn away from her. “Just tell me she’s the one who’s wrong. And don’t gang up on me!” she wanted to cry out, but she didn’t, and swallowed the words.
	</p>
	<p>“That doesn’t justify her being so cold and mean to me, though,” she sobbed instead.
	</p>
	<p>After being pushed away, Tsahn ran his hand through his hair and rubbed the back of his neck.
	</p>
	<p>“No,” he sighed, “you’re right. It doesn’t.”
	</p>
	<p>Aestas wiped her face with the sleeve of her summer cloak.
	</p>
	<p>“And it’s not like I want this, too,” she gulped, feeling sorry for herself. “I don’t even want to join the festival this year.”
	</p>
	<p>“I’m sorry that you feel that way, Aestas,” Tsahn said, voice strained but still gentle.
	</p>
	<p>“And I just want to enjoy my youth outdoors, and not inside. If Candentia likes responsibilities so much, and is so judgy, why doesn’t she just do everything herself? It’ll save both of our time,” she strained, “It’s not like I asked to be who I am, anyways. Being a sister to her is just so tiresome. If I had known, I wouldn’t have followed her here in the first place.”
	</p>
	<p>“Fine,” a cold voice sounded suddenly from the end of the hallway.
	</p>
	<p>Tsahn and Aestas turned their heads. It was Candentia. She was holding a bundle of dresses in her arms, the pile so big her lower face was covered, hence you could only see her eyes. 
	</p>
	<p>She had just come upstairs to put all the dresses back to where they came from. And stopped in her tracks when she heard the conversation. 
	</p>
	<p>Tsahn’s heart dropped to his stomach, knowing Candentia, from merely looking at her eyes, knew that she was beyond angry and on the brink of snapping, or crying— he couldn’t decide which was worse. Candentia Hyacinth rarely did either, and people that knew her preferred it that way. 
	</p>
	<p>Candentia took in a long breath of air and repeated— “fine.” Her tone was as icy as her glare. 
	</p>
	<p>“You do it your way, I don’t care anymore. I’ll just mind my own business from now on. Nobody forced you to choose the Nix over the main castle.”
	</p>
	<p>She stormed into her room and shoved the door, the slam making Aestas grit her teeth. The sound of doors closing hard was one of the sounds that she loathed. 
	</p>
	<p>Aestas yanked out the long silver hairpin that was in her half-tied-up hair and ran up to the closed door of her sister's bedroom. She banged twice— hard, on the door with the hand holding the hairpin, it stuck two holes in the wooden patterns. 
	</p>
	<p>Inside, Candentia jumped slightly and looked over her shoulder at the door. She turned back and flung the dresses on the floor. She had to bite down on her lower lip hard to suppress a low growl of anger that rumbled from her throat. While contemplating whether or not to storm out for a moment, she heard her sister's muffled scream from the other side— “You, wanting everything to be perfect, is just so <b>pathetic</b>! And pushing that on me won’t make me a better heir. The pressure you’re putting on me is only going to suffocate and kill me one day! And yes! No one forced me to, but I chose to come live at the Nix because I actually wanted to stay close with you! But if I had known you were going to be like this, I would've never moved here with you!! Arrrggg!” 
	</p>
	<p>Aestas pulled the hairpin out from the wooden door and ran down the hall, into her own room and slammed her own door.
	</p>
	<p>Tsahn, who witnessed everything, didn’t know whether to follow Aestas or to knock on Candentia’s door. He leaned his head sideways on the frame of his own door and closed his eyes. Maybe it’s best to leave both of the sisters alone.
	</p>
	<p>Bam! A loud thud came from the other side of the door across the hall. Tsahn jerked open his eyes. The wooden door covered with carvings of mountains and snowflakes opened slightly.
	</p>
	<p>“You heard all of it, didn't you?” Tsahn Aourthyerhl asked Candentia, who had slowly peeked her head out from behind the door. She was taking deep breaths.
	</p>
	<p>“Yea— I did, what do you think?” she smiled weakly, her bottom lip had a little bit of blood on it. “Shouldn’t have lost my temper though,” she added calmly, looked at her door, and rubbed on the new holes. 
	</p>
	<p>“<i>Damn</i>— was that a hairpin?” she laughed softly, voice strained.
	</p>
	<p>Tsahn, who didn’t know what to say, just nodded. The other was acting too calm for his preference, as it only made his concern build up even more. He had known Candentia for too long to know that under the calmness of the gray eyes, there was actually a raging storm.
	</p>
	<p>“Just great,” she scoffed under her breath, “it’s not coming off.”  —but she kept rubbing.
	</p>
	<p>A hand gently grabbed her wrist and stopped her movements.
	</p>
	<p>“That's not going to make the mark gone, Tsahn Aouthyerhl said, “you know forcing it like that would only make it worse.”
	</p>
	<p>“I know,” Candentia Hyacinth sighed, “but I can't help it. I see a hole somewhere, and I want to fix it.”
	</p>
	<p>“I think I know what you mean though,” she added, and glanced at Tsahn— it looked as if the boy had something he wanted to say.
	</p>
	<p>She lowered her hand and gave him a tiny nod— mentioning for him to go on with whatever that was on his mind. He leaned backwards against the wall in the hallway and looked down at her sideways.
	</p>
	<p>“We might actually have to consider finding a different approach to Aestas,” he said thoughtfully, “although what I’m thinking of is asking a lot from your part.”
	</p>
	<p>“Yeah? What’s your advice?” Candentia asked, leaning sideways against her own door frame and listened intently— her face gradually stiffened as the other went on— but she nodded slowly, trying to digest Tsahn’s honest words.
	</p>
	<p class="p">Back in her room, Aestas had curled up against the cushions of her window. She was hugging her knees while tears fell from her eyes. 
	</p>
	<p> “There is no pain so great as the memory of joy in present grief,” a voice kept repeating in her head. It was what she had heard Candentia whisper out loud a few weeks ago in the library. The sentence had replayed in her mind more than she preferred, and was the perfect reflection of what she kept feeling these days.
	</p>
	<p>Aestas had forgotten the specific reason she went to fetch for her big sister that day, but can still recall, to this day, how she had stopped abruptly in her tracks and hid immediately behind the bookshelves the moment she caught a sniffle.
	</p>
	<p class="p">Aestas had tiptoed closer quietly and peeked through the cracks of the uneven books leaning against one another. 
	</p>
	<p>The older was wearing blue that day, the kind that resembled a pale morning sky. There, by the window that overlooked the apple blossoms, she sat, flipping the pages of a dusty book as her eyes watered up, her silk dress and blue ribbons snuck against cousins. The book her nose was buried in, was one Aestas recognized. The copper writing in bold font on its black cover, told her that it was a book teaching the old tales of magic. 
	</p>
	<p>“There is no pain so great as the memory of joy in present grief,” Candentia had murmured softly, reading one of the dialogues where a flower asked the wise wind the reason it was in pain. 
	</p>
	<p>The older girl then sneezed and rubbed her eyes. 
	</p>
	<p>“It must be the dust, then” Aestas had thought, “and not her tears.”
	</p>
	<p>But in fear of encountering any heavy emotions, she quietly slipped away and ran down the stairs. She vaguely remembered that it was Tsahn who fetched her sister in the end.
	</p>
	<p>Or was it Aurelius? 
	</p>
	<p class="p">Doesn’t matter.
	</p>
	<p class="p">The last ray of sunshine had slipped below the horizon, and the world seemed still. The constellations shone bright with the two twinkling twin stars shining, just rising from behind the mountain tops. With only starlight shining through the windows, her room felt dark and empty. Whenever she let her guard down and let the buzz of excitement in her mind dissipate, all that she could hear were the slamming of doors, breaking of vases, shouts of her parents, whispers of people, worrying of officials, scolding of her teachers, and the icy tone of her older sister. Everything these days was overwhelming. And she felt tired. 
	</p>
	<p><i>Just so damn tired</i>—
	</p>
	<p>“I’m doing the best I can,” Aestas murmured shakily. She buried her face in her arms and cried. 
	</p>
	<p class="pend"> However the cold and silence might not seem to be a bother to Candentia— for Aestas, it has always consumed her, and she despised it.  
	</p>
