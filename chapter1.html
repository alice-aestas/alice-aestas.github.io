	<h2 class="chapter title">Brontes Laers</h2>
<div class="chaptercontent">
	<p><b class="b">S</b>ummer has always been the most vigorous season of the year in Annyo City— capital of Land Hyacinthous, with brilliant colors and light, dazzling throughout the busy streets. Excitement buzzed, starting from the coast, crept through the green-lushed, stone-paved lanes, and boiled up to the hills as the city began its annual countdown, towards the anticipated festival of summer. 
	</p>
	<p>Dry and hot was the summer air, but the shadows of the trees that towered over the streets provided a certain coolness to the land, making it bearable to roam outdoors.  
	</p>
	<p class="p">There, on the doorsteps of one of the icing-coloured, pretty little houses that stood stoutly by the edge of the terrace, Brontes Laers sat with his chin resting on his knees, with a piece of paper clutched tightly in his hand. 
	</p>
	<p>He had sat there for some time, waiting for the owner to come home. The shop— Krelnein’s badges— was supposed to be open, but to his dismay, he had found a piece of paper taped to the inner side of the door with the words— “be right back!” written in hasty handwriting. As a matter of fact, he had no choice but to wait, as of all the wonderful shops in Annyo city, the object he was seeking for could only be found at this particular place. 
	</p>
	<p>Despite its beautiful structure and color, the shop did look a bit plain from the outside when you compare it with the other ones that decorated the alley, for it had plain glass windows with no fancy drawings or writing, and plain curtains that were pale gray with a slight tint of pale blue. With the shops that scattered across town being ten times fancier than the next, one could say that this particular one is definitely not eye-catching at all, and could easily be ignored even when the alley was crowded by shoppers, as was in the moment. 
	</p>
	<p>If one looked closely, it would not be hard to tell that this plain store is actually one of the few important shops that were labeled as “official suppliers” for the castle, for one small insignia painted in black could be found on the shop’s sign. The size and design of that one tiny, black totem may be seemingly insignificant, but it does hold more importance than you could ever guess. 
	</p>
	<p>As Brontes gazed absentmindedly at the flocks of passersby, he wondered who the shopkeeper could be, and how clever their skills were, that somehow the store could manage to withstand time and change, and still hold its place and name on the “List Of Honor.” He imagined that the shopkeeper might be someone like his grandfather, who held his moral high and treated every customer as if they were his own family; or maybe they would turn out to be like his grandmother, who had the most terrific skills when it comes to carving wooden figures. 
	</p>
	<p>These guessing games stirred his memory of his family, whom he had not seen for almost three years. They only lived on the other side of the city, but he still had to finish his last year of training to be allowed to see them again. He was in a training program for future official swordsmen of the Citadel. Thus, even after he came back to Annyo, he had to live in the army wing of the palace and was forbidden to visit any acquaintances during his final year of training. It was cruel, yes, but it was a reasonable challenge to overcome, as the criteria and tests for becoming a member of the Royal Army was necessarily strict.
	</p>
	<p>To become an official member of the Royal Army, one would have to join the summer or winter seasonal program as a primary trainee at the Citadel as the first step. Then, would be distributed to the foreign training centers in the other four lands and undergo at least two years of training as an advanced trainee, before even being qualified to join the competition of the summer or winter selection of associate members of the Royal Army. The few that were talented enough to be made associate members, would then return to Annyo city of Land Hyacinthous for one last year of ultimate training before they could make it to the list of official members, and have their names be announced at the summer or winter ceremony in Annyo. 
	</p>
	<p>Brontes Laers closed his eyes and smiled as a sudden taste of bitter-sweetness gradually crept to the tip of his tongue. He had been away for so long that he almost forgot how the afternoon air of his hometown tasted like. 
	</p>
	<p>Even after his return to Annyo as an associate member of the Royal Army, he had spent most of his days in the training centers in the Royal Swordsmen Department building, and this was actually the first time that he was allowed to roam the alleys of Pagiet, shopping district, in broad daylight— under the orders of his superiors. The alleys on the westside of Pagiet Lane were one of Brontes’ favorite places to visit at night, after training and before curfew. At the end of the alleys is a small lane that ran alongside the edge of the terrace of Annyo city, and over the low stone wall, the inner seas of Land Hyacinthous could be seen. After most of the stores had been closed, with only a few lights coming from a few windows, the stars would be visible, emerging from the east, from the mountain tops, stretching through the skies of Annyo, and spreading miles and miles over the dim but simmering waves in the west. 
	</p>
	<p><i>The stars</i>, he recalled, were the most breathtaking at this time of year. 
	</p>
	<p>It had been some time since he had the chance to go stargazing, as he had been in training for two years in another continent that was two seas and six islands away. 
	</p>
	<p>He hummed in contentment as he listened to the boisterous chatter that filled the alley in the present moment. He missed everything, and was glad to be able to come back again, though he did wish he could somehow accidentally run into his family on the streets, without breaking the rules. 
	</p>
	<p>He sighed. 
	</p>
	<p><i>Just one month left to go and I’m free. </i>
	</p>
	<p>At least he was one of the lucky twelve in the southern branch of advance training centers that were qualified to join the official team this summer. The rest of his fellow advanced trainees would have to wait for the winter tournament to seize the chance. 
	</p>
	<p>It was a dream come true for Brontes Laers to become a member of the Royal Army (which we will from now on call it “the R.A.” for short), despite that becoming a swordsman was not his first choice. 
	</p>
	<p>There are three departments in the R.A. altogether― the Royal Enchanters Department (R.E.D.), which consists of Enchanters, who wielded their powers and weaved spells; then there’s the Royal Swordsmen Department (R.S.D.), which consists of Swordsmen, who perform the art of deadly weapons when necessary; and there’s the Royal Windriders Department (R.W.R.), which consists of Windriders, who live by their name and surf the wind. 
	</p>
	<p>Of all three departments, Brontes’ childhood dream was to become a windrider— one of those heroes that could ride the raging wind. Fate, however, wasn’t as kind as he thought it would be, and on the day of the announcement of the selection and assignment, he was crestfallen to learn that although he got into the R.A. with the highest score in total, he had not been assigned to the R.W.D. — where he wanted to go, and had to leave Annyo for two years training. 
	</p>
	<p>He could still remember how the lump in his throat threatened his tears to drop when his family and friends showered him with their congratulations. 
	</p>
	<p>Shaking his head, Brontes tried to clear the memory out of his mind. 
	</p>
	<p>“Excuse me,” a sweet voice sounded from above, pulling Brontes back into reality.
	</p>
	<p>Brontes sat up and looked around. No one on the streets was talking to him. He tilted his head, puzzled. Did he fall into a slumber?
	</p>
	<p>“Up here,” the voice sounded again, “I’m up here, above you.”
	</p>
	<p>He stood up and turned around, eyes searching the upper windows, and sure enough, there was a girl waving at him from the second floor, blue ribbons and blond curls swaying gently to the brush of the breeze.
	</p>
	<p>“Good day,” he greeted as he stuck both his hands in his pockets and bowed his head slightly. 
	</p>
	<p>“Are you waiting for the store to open, dear?” she asked brightly.
	</p>
	<p>“Yes, ma’am,” he bowed his head again and smiled up sweetly. 
	</p>
	<p>“Why, you really are well mannered,” laughed the girl, “call me Trina,” she said, “and sorry for keeping you waiting. I will be down in a jiffy.”
	</p>
	<p>Her blond curls soon disappeared out of sight. Bontes Laers wondered if she was the daughter of the owner, for she looked rather young and could be around seventeen or eighteen. There wasn’t too much time for him to think about it, because soon enough, the lights of the shop were turned on, and the door opened up, revealing a dazzling sight. 
	</p>
	<p>The blond girl, Trina, stood by the door with a radiant smile on her face. And beyond her were the most beautiful badges Brontes had ever seen. They were scattered on the tables, stored on shelves, and hung on walls. The color of the walls were of the same dull bluish-gray as the curtains, but the delicate badges turned the shop to life. 
	</p>
	<p>Brontes stared in awe and let out a whistle.
	</p>
	<p>“I’m sorry if it’s a bit messy,” Trina apologized, thinking that the lad was struck by the untidiness of the shop.
	</p>
	<p>“No, no, it looks wonderful this way,” he said, and stepped hurriedly inside, “I mean it,” he quickly added when he saw the skeptical look on Trina’s face, “it gives off the magical vibe when beautiful things aren’t in order.”
	</p>
	<p>“Thank you then. I accept the compliment,” Trina giggled and followed him inside, leaving the door open, “what brings you here today?”
	</p>
	<p>Now that they were standing close enough, Bontes could see that her eyes, round and wide, staring up at him, were of a soft baby blue. His lips curved into a smile as he returned her gaze. She blushed and looked away.
	</p>
	<p>“I’m here to see the owner of this shop. My superiors told me to deliver a piece of information and wait for further orders,” he said.
	</p>
	<p>“Well, then you have come to your destination,” she said, reaching out her hand, “let me see what I can do.”
	</p>
	<p>“Umm, instructions were that I see the owner of Krelnein’s badges in person, and…” he trailed off, “and I’m not sure who you are, exactly?”
	</p>
	<p>“Dumbass,” a dark voice suddenly shot from the corner of the room. Brontes Laers spun around, stance ready and alert. No ordinary person could easily escape his ability to detect almost every living thing near him. 
	</p>
	<p>His eyes narrowed as soon he was met with another girl. She had silky black hair, darker than the night, and piercing amber eyes that glinted with rusty orange. 
	</p>
	<p>“She <i>is</i> the owner of Krelnein’s badges, you dimwit,” she jeered, “and you call yourself a Swordsman when you can’t even notice another person in the room?” 
	</p>
	<p>“Lena,” he hissed, “what are you doing here?”
	</p>
	<p>“Laers,” she nodded at him, a cold smile on her face “tis pleasant to see you, too.”
	</p>
	<p>Brontes turned to Trina, “what is she doing here? Do you know her? And you are the owner?!”
	</p>
	<p>Trina shrugged, “to see that you two know each other, I would assume that your mission is the same as hers.”
	</p>
	<p>“And as a matter of fact— yes, I <i>do</i> know her. She is a close friend of mine. And to answer your third question— ” 
	</p>
	<p>She took a deep breath and muttered, ”<i>goodness</i>, people <i>do</i> like to ask so many things at the same time. What is wrong with them? It doesn’t even matter how good looking they are at this point.” 
	</p>
	<p>Brontes Laers coughed out of surprise.
	</p>
	<p>Trina covered her mouth and looked frantically at Ivian Lena, “shit, Ivian, did I say that out loud?”
	</p>
	<p>Ivian Lena shrugged and continued to sip her cup of coffee, “this is good coffee, Trina,” she commented. 
	</p>
	<p>Trina peered at Brontes, who looked rather amused, “I am sorry,” she said in a tiny voice, “please pretend you heard nothing.”
	</p>
	<p>Brontes opened his mouth to tell her that he didn’t mind, but before he could say anything, she cut in— “and now, if you will, hand me that piece of paper so I can get to work. I chatted for too long with Ivian here and… I’m running out of time.”
	</p>
	<p>Trina turned away as soon as the paper was safe in her tiny hands. Her blond curls bounced behind her as she scurried to the next room.
	</p>
	<p>“She’s cute, huh?” Ivian Lena smiled, her aggressive tone gone for a moment. 
	</p>
	<p>“Yea, kinda,” Brontes Laers couldn’t help but break a smile, “how old is she though? She looks hella young for an official supplier.”
	</p>
	<p>“Same age as we are,” she replied, “and she’s actually more than an official supplier—” she paused for a second and added with some harshness in her voice, “ — but out of your league. Don’t you dare go after her.”
	</p>
	<p>He raised his eyebrows.
	</p>
	<p>“No one’s out of my league,” he smirked, “and do you care about me so much that you don’t want me chasing other people? …That’s sweet— but no, thank you.”
	</p>
	<p>Ivian Lena rolled her eyes. “In your dreams.”
	</p>
	<p>He sat down beside Lena and peered at the delicate badges. If these were the work of a twenty-three year old, then she sure is a hell of a genius.
	</p>
	<p>“So the same mission?” he questioned, to which she hummed.
	</p>
	<p>“It’s not exactly a ‘mission’ if you think of it,” she said thoughtfully.
	</p>
	<p>“But rather?”
	</p>
	<p>“A celebration.”
	</p>
	<p>“Oh? So that’s what a new badge is for? A celebration?”
	</p>
	<p>“See for yourself,” she smiled slyly, “it’s no fun just telling you.”
	</p>
	<p>They sat in silence for quite a while, and even after Trina came back into the room and handed them receipts, ordering for them to “chat until I finish the last touch of magic,” they both remained quiet and watched in awe as Trina started to work on the two badges before her.
	</p>
	<p>Sparks flew around like crazy fireflies as Trina worked her way into the two pieces of metal with a small transparent needle in hand.
	</p>
	<p>Brontes recognized instantly by the dazzling light bouncing off the needle and onto the walls, that the thing in Trina’s hand was no ordinary object, but a needle made of crystal stone. 
	</p>
	<p>Crystal Weavers were one of the most rare enchanters there are these days, their art once considered lost after the great war with the north, which wreaked great havoc on Planet Csettrecsran. 
	</p>
	<p class="p">Legend says that the night before the Boundary Enchantment was stealed upon the great north, all northern crystals lost their shimmer and turned dim, leaving the cities that relied on the power of the stones in the darkness of chaos, including most of The Citadel. 
	</p>
	<p>People had scurried out of their houses, and on to the moonlit streets, in fear of a catastrophe in the wake. 
	</p>
	<p>“Even the castle has lost its light!” they shouted.
	</p>
	<p>“We are all doomed!”
	</p>
	<p>“The north has finally bitten back!”
	</p>
	<p>“Didn’t they say we were winning the war?”
	</p>
	<p>Fear and anger filled the marbled streets.
	</p>
	<p>Amongst the confusion, a little boy called out, “look! there’s still light in the wind tower!”
	</p>
	<p>His voice was drowned by the panicking crowd, but as he climbed on top of the fountain, which at the moment, no water was running out. His mother noticed him and screamed for her child to come down. The boy ignored her calls and pointed uphill. The moonlight was bright enough for everyone to see where he was pointing. They turned in the direction of his extended hand. And sure enough, there it stood, glowing against the darkness of the night, was one of the three towers that stood stoutly near the castle. 
	</p>
	<p>Apart from the moon and stars, the only thing shining on Hyacinthous that night was fire on candles and wood, fairy dust in glass jars, and the large southern crystal embedded on the bell of the wind tower. The gem was said to be a friendly gift from one of the Great Chiefs of the Southern Migratory Tribes.
	</p>
	<p>On the next day, under the king’s orders, Hyacinthous enchanters and swordsmen set out immediately to the Southern lands, and within three years, southern crystals soon replaced the old northern ones, and Land Hyacinthous bathed in light again. 
	</p>
	<p>How the northern crystals lost all their powers overnight is a mystery yet to be uncoded. But with southern crystals shining bright, there wasn’t much complaining for the people of Hyacinthous to do. The only difference was that compared to the bright, cool light of Northern crystals, the light that the southern ones omitted was much more dim, yet more warm. The warmth of the crystals weren’t much of a problem as long as they weren’t used as magicalware of enchanters. Due to the extreme difficulty to control the power of southern crystals in Crystal Weaving, most enchanters gave up on the art. It was said that only a few talented enchanters left could come near to performing the magic without causing casualty. 
	</p>
	<p>If Trina Krelnein could master the art, well enough to take orders from the R.A., no doubt the powers of the young enchantress were strong.
	</p>
	<p class="p">Brontes was lost in his thoughts when a voice sounded next to him.
	</p>
	<p>“Hey, Laers,”
	</p>
	<p>It was Lena, who finally decided to break the suffocating silence between them. 
	</p>
	<p>With her eyes still trained on Trina’s fast-moving hands, she asked Brontes Laers in a low voice, “do you look forward to becoming an official member of the R.A.?”
	</p>
	<p>“Of course,” Brontes Laers answered almost instantly, voice also hushed, “why wouldn’t I?”
	</p>
	<p>“I mean-” she hesitated, but went on, “everyone knows that becoming a Swordsman ain’t what you wanted. And what we are getting into would be stuck with us for life,” she turned her head to look at him, “aren’t you afraid that you might be unsatisfied and unhappy in the future?”
	</p>
	<p>Taken aback, Brontes didn’t know how to answer this question. Was he looking forward to joining the R.A. even if it meant that he might not be able to do what he previously wanted? To be honest, he did not feel reconciled when he thought about his future life. He knew he was good at what he was doing and rather enjoyed it, but sometimes when he thought about Windriders, something inside still stirred, and he would feel a type of longing which he could not describe. 
	</p>
	<p>Ivian Lena took this opportunity to take a good look at Laers’ features. His bushy eyebrows were furrowed at the moment, and he was nibbling on his lower lip, but it was obvious that this was a face carved with extra care by whoever created it. The boy’s hair had grown out since they came back to Annyo, and his silky strands of ashy black hair draped slightly over his olive-green colored eyes. The new hairstyle rather suited him, she thought, though he did manage to rock the buzz cut throughout their three-year training. 
	</p>
	<p>Ivian Lena shook her head and smiled, recalling how the girls at camp would gush over his toned figure and perfectly sculpted face, and there were the squeals that broke out here and there whenever he waved at them. He definitely knew that he was one for the eyes and often used it to his own advantage, for example, to get extra shares of dessert. 
	</p>
	<p>Ivian secretly agreed with the girls about his features but refused to admit it out loud, as she and the boy did not get along, and were considered ultimate rivals during their days at camp. It would simply be overly pride-wrecking to admit such a thing, not to mention being teased by her friends, or even worse, by the devil himself. 
	</p>
	<p>She shuddered. No, she would have to get rid of him if that happened. Maybe killing him in his sleep would be fine.
	</p>
	<p>As Brontes Laers shifted in his seat while trying to find a more comfortable position to contemplate about the question, a sudden gust of wind shoved him hard, almost making him topple over. 
	</p>
	<p>Pieces of paper went flying while several badges were blown off the shelves and tables. He held onto the table for balance and scoffed. Judging from the speed of the passing shadows and the sound of the people outside gasping in awe, he didn’t even have to look up to know who the incomers were. 
	</p>
	<p>His speculation was confirmed by Lena.
	</p>
	<p>“Windriders,” she hissed in his ear, “there’s three of them.”
And there they were, three young men, all in their summer uniforms, shining with glory. Brontes found it hard to meet them in the eye, let alone greet them, for his jealousy was eating him up. 
	</p>
	<p>He had seen several R.W.R. members during the course of his training in the castle grounds, but this was his first time actually meeting them in person. He definitely underestimated his own obsession of becoming a Windrider, and was overwhelmed by the sudden sight of them to say even a word.
	</p>
	<p>“Ay, ain’t this one what they call ‘the storm?’” one of the boys exclaimed when he caught sight of Brontes and beckoned to him. “Come here, let us take a good look at what the gossip is about.”
	</p>
	<p>“Careful there,” one of them laughed, voice deep, “rumor says he’s a big baby and can’t control his temper. We wouldn’t want to get hurt now, would we?”
	</p>
	<p>Brontes snapped his head up. The tallest of the three was gazing right at him, smirking. His hair parted from the middle, and his eyes were of a piercing black—a rare color in Annyo. The guy had slightly arched brows that were the same color of his hair, which was chestnut-brown. Brontes was taken aback when he noticed that the guy was rather young, and had an extremely attractive face, which pissed him off even more.
	</p>
	<p>“What did you just call me?” Brontes Laers tried to sound calm.
	</p>
	<p>“Ah, now I’ve got your attention,” said the brunette. 
	</p>
	<p>The sudden urge of grabbing the other by the throat surged in Brontes’ blood, but he refrained from doing so.
	</p>
	<p>“I meant to ask you which name do you like best,” the brunette smirked, “‘Stormy’ or ‘Big baby’?”
	</p>
	<p>At this, Brontes jumped up and flung his punch.
	</p>
	<p>Ivian Lena, who however saw this coming, leapt up faster and grabbed her fellow trainee’s arm, holding him back down to his seat. 
	</p>
	<p>As much as she enjoyed the sight of him getting stomped over, she didn’t wish for a fight to break out before their training ended, especially if it was in Trina’s shop.
	</p>
	<p>“We can’t mess up before our graduation,” she warned him quietly before growling at the other three, “don’t want to lose an arm before the festival, huh? I’d advise you to back off.”
	</p>
	<p>The windriders snickered, but stepped back. 
	</p>
	<p>“Aww, he’s got a pet dragon to spit fire for him. He is a big baby,” the one on the right sneered, “no wonder our department refused to take him in.”
	</p>
	<p class="p">It felt as if someone just threw a punch in his chest.
	</p>
	<p class="p">“Now, now. Let him be,” the brunette said, “now’s not the time to pick fights.”
	</p>
	<p>“Says the one practically begging him to kill you,” Lena laughed coldly.
	</p>
	<p>“Well,” the brunette shrugged, “the festival’s coming near, and our ‘stormy’ here’s waiting for his graduation. We can’t ruin his only chance to join the R.A., can we?” he raised an eyebrow at Brontes, and went on, “it’s his best chance to get close to us Windriders, after all.”
	</p>
	<p>Heat rushed up Brontes’ neck and onto his face, but he said nothing, keeping Lena’s words in mind. 
	</p>
	<p><i>They’re dead if I meet them after the festival’s over</i>, he thought darkly to himself. The truth is, he couldn’t think up any witty remarks as a comeback. The brown-haired Windrider’s words struck him hard and it stung. 
	</p>
	<p>“Let go of me, Lena,” he said under his breath.
	</p>
	<p>Ivian Lena, full of doubt, hesitated.
	</p>
	<p>“I’ll be fine. I promise,” he said. 
	</p>
	<p>“...” and she released him from her grasp.
	</p>
	<p>As Brontes took several deep breaths and stood up. The Windriders took a step back.
	</p>
	<p>Lena watched in concern as Brontes simply walked calmly over to pick up the scattered objects. She could tell that he was close to exploding. The boy had a habit of tuning his jealousy into hatred, and embarrassment into rage, which she and their fellow trainees have often witnessed. Some of the trainees disliked him for his anger issues, though they dared not talk about it in front of him, due to the fear of getting beaten up. “The storm,” was what they called Brontes Laers behind his back when they were talking shit about him. 
	</p>
	<p>He, himself, <i>did</i> know about the nickname, and he <i>was</i> well aware that his anger issues could get in the way of his achievements if he didn’t try and learn to control it. He <i>did</i> try, but still, his temper often got the best of him, which had further gotten him into a fair amount of fights.
	</p>
	<p class="p">“<i>You do realize you’re just venting out on us, don’t you</i>?” a memory of Ivian Lena’s furious face emerged in his mind, “keep fucking around with that pathetic temper of yours and someone will … no, I will make sure you won’t have anything to do with the R.A., and then you can go moping around for all I care!”
	</p>
	<p>She was shaking with anger as she barged towards Brontes Laers, her amber eyes flashing with a dangerous glint. Despite their fellow trainees’ attempt to hold them apart, there had been more insults, and even a few punches thrown at one another. They both ended up getting detention after their superiors barged in and pulled them away.
	</p>
	<p>“One more fight and you both will be kicked out of the program, let alone having the chance of joining the royal army,” the commanding officer had threatened.
	</p>
	<p class="p">
	</p>
	<p>Brontes clenched his teeth and squeezed his fist.
	</p>
	<p>Joining the R.A. was too important to him, and few snarky comments from the intruders should be ignored. Fighting before the festival was simply unworthy.
	</p>
	<p>Ivian Lena relaxed when Trina Krelnein stepped between them, facing the other three boys. At least none of them would dare to fight in front of the shopkeepers’ sight.
	</p>
	<p>“Esen,” Trina said to the brunette, “do you not want your orders to be done? If so, you three could step out of this shop this instant, if you please.”
	</p>
	<p>“My apologies to you, Trina,” Esen said, “we got a bit carried away,” and then he turned to Brontes, “apologies to you, too. I do hope we meet again.”
	</p>
	<p>He paused and winked at Brontes before his exit through the door, “maybe we could sign autographs for you then.”
	</p>
	<p>The other two hooted with laughter as Brontes shook with rage.
	</p>
	<p>“Enough,” snapped Trina, and she shooed the boys out the door once she took a piece of paper from Esen, “off you go. And please do remember to come back tomorrow to collect your badges.”
	</p>
	<p>Brontes watched with his jaw clenched, as the Windriders took off to the sky on their windboards. He shook his head with disbelief.
	</p>
	<p>“Didn’t know Windriders were such dickheads,” Ivian Lena said monotonously. She took a glance at Brontes’ flustered face and added with detectable laughter in her voice, “but I sure was entertained. Thanks for the show, brother,” she gave him a pat on the back, “never have I ever seen you look so red in my life.”
	</p>
	<p>“Mind your own business,” Brontes Laers grunted, “or else it’ll be you who will be spitting red.”
	</p>
	<p>“Prepare to close the shutters, ladies and gentlemen, ‘the storm’ is raging again. It was the highlight of my day when the guy named Esen called you a big baby. You couldn’t even say anything back, could you?”
	</p>
	<p>The furious Laers took the smirking Lena by the collar and growled, “<i>fuck you</i>. And like I said, ‘<i>mind your own business.</i>’”
	</p>
	<p>“Mind <i>your</i> language,” Trina butt in, “no one is killing anyone in my shop. Take your own childish fights elsewhere.” She handed the duo two small packages, “and here’s your souvenir for this memorable day.”
	</p>
	<p>Brontes then let go of Ivian Lena, who smiled sheepishly at the store keeper. Trina Krelnein was not amused of all that racket, and was hoping the two were going to leave soon. She leaned on the counter and sighed loudly. It had been a long day and she was now craving for some muffins and a cup of hot chamomile tea.
	</p>
	<p>Ivian took the hint and got up. “Well, it’s nice seeing you again, Trina. I suppose next time we meet we can finally walk the streets together.” She looked at Brontes, “do you smell the scent of freedom? It is just around the corner.”
	</p>
	<p>Trina rubbed her forehead and sighed, “if only you stay out of trouble and graduate from the program. Or else you will not get your precious freedom. You are damn lucky to get chosen, you know that? Don’t fuck it up,” she looked at Brontes straight in the eye, “and that goes to both of you.”  
	</p>
	<p>Brontes smiled, “mind your language, Trina. Such words shouldn’t come out of that pretty mouth, eh?”
	</p>
	<p>Lena rolled her eyes for the hundredth time. And now he’s back to normal.
	</p>
	<p>“Oh, let me live in peace,” the blond girl blushed, and she waved her hand dismissively, “out you go, both of you. Good day. Goodbye. It was <i>such a pleasure</i> to be at your service. Don’t come back. Goodbye!”
	</p>
	<p>“I hope she doesn’t mean it,” Brontes said under his breath to Lena as the two scurried towards the door. 
	</p>
	<p>“It’s very hard to tell. She actually reminds me of that brunette that was taunting you today,” she whispered, and added after seeing the confusion in his eyes, “the tallest of the Windriders? The one who called you a big baby?”
	</p>
	<p>“Don’t remind me of the details. I’ve decided to forget the whole incident,” he said with a pained voice.
	</p>
	<p>“How can you forget such a face? He was the definition of stunning,”  she protested.
	</p>
	<p>“Since when did you start caring about what other people look like?” he inquired, although he did have to agree with Lena. That was a fair-looking Windrider, which made the hatred towards him ten times intense. <i>At least he’s just some errand boy for the R.W.R., no one with a high status, while I will have numerous opportunities to be someone great once I become an official member</i>, Brontes comforted himself.
	</p>
	<p>“And how can you say he’s stunning when someone this attractive is walking next to you?” he slipped his hand through his own hair.
	</p>
	<p>Ivian Lena pretended to puke.
	</p>
	<p>“Come on. I’m not that bad,” he whined.
	</p>
	<p>She glanced sideways at him. His skin was glowing under the touch of the golden-hour-sunlight, while his jawline, square and sharp, casted even shadows down his neck. And the curve from his nose down to his mouth and chin was of a perfect shape with straight lines and sharp turns— and she found it hard to tear her eyes away. 
	</p>
	<p><i>Damn that perfect side profile— he’s still a jerk.  </i>
	</p>
	<p>“Well… all I can say is that you two are not the same type,” she shrugged.
	</p>
	<p>“Now, I can’t tell if that’s a compliment or not, but I’m sure glad we’re different,” his tone was much more relaxed, “I mean, who would want to be like that Esen guy. Life would be too sad…”
	</p>
	<p class="p">The sky was clear as it has been during most days of the first quarter of summer, with only a few clouds lacing the mountain tops. A group of teenagers ran by, bringing a gust of laughter with them. Brontes gazed at their joyful shadows as they pranced playfully up the hill. Youth is something people say everyone is bound to experience, but however, in Brontes’ opinion, youth is a luxury, a privilege, something so close yet so hard for him to grasp. 
	</p>
	<p class="pend">There was a glint of longing in Brontes Laers’ olive green eyes as a small sigh escaped his lips. And somehow, Ivian Lena understood what it was.
