<div class="chaptercontent">
	<p><b class="b">T</b>he sky was a clean, cool blue, after being washed by the early spring rain overnight. Aurelius Solicas walked quietly, falling a few steps behind Candentia Hyacinth, as they passed through the narrow passage in between the tall shrubs. 
	</p>
	<p>The dampness of the leaves crept through the thin fabric of their cloaks, sending light chills down their skin, which was taken away, almost immediately, by the morning sun.
	</p>
	<p>They soon arrived at an opening, before entering a small grove. The shadows of tall trees shielded them from above as they passed through the warm rays of slanting sunshine. And from between the dark brown trunks, one could see that spring had crept its way into Annyo city, leaving traces of bright colors all over the gray canvas of the previous season. 
	</p>
	<p>Under the gradient blue sky, yellow and purple hyacinths were almost in full bloom, decorating the carpet of soft green that spread through the garden grounds. 
	</p>
	<p>The tiny dots of light danced and shimmered on the smooth, large stones beneath their feet as Aurelius and Candenita made their way through from under the canopy; a sudden breeze brushed through the branches above, conducting a bright, yet soothing song, with the soft rustling of leaves and lively chirp of birds. 
	</p>
	<p><i>“Did you know—”</i>
	</p>
	<p>The girl turned around swiftly as she tread lightly on her toes, backwards. 
	</p>
	<p>A soft strand of ashy black got caught in between her plump lips as a gust of wind dived past; the tip of her tongue showed as she brushed the curls behind an ear. 
	</p>
	<p>“Did you know,” she started again, tone full of delight, “that these little round spots on the ground— are actually pinhole images of the sun?” 
	</p>
	<p>Aurelius stuck his hands in his pockets and hastened his footsteps, catching up beside her. He chuckled— a melodic sound that resembled low string instruments being played gently. “Yeah,” he said, “fascinating, isn’t it?”
	</p>
	<p>Candentia hummed, footsteps light as she stepped from dot to dot, balancing, as if dancing on the surface of quiet waters. 
	</p>
	<p>“Every one of them,” she said, voice hushed, “is a burning sun.”
	</p>
	<p>The pair walked in comfortable silence, both savoring the rare tranquility that sunk in between them. It felt nice for a change— not quarreling or competing with one another. 
	</p>
	<p>The fresh scent of the early spring flowers grew stronger as they entered the inner circle of the castle gardens, and the sound of humming bees intensified. Butterflies fluttered, the dust of their wings shimmered in the air as the warm sunshine hit the particles. 
	</p>
	<p>The plants were trimmed low in the area— to the height that barely reached Aurelius’ waist, and he hovered a hand over the damp bushes, flicking occasionally at the tender pink and pure white that peeked out shyly from the rich green. The soft petals bounced at his touch, tossing delicate drops of water into the air, rolling and scattering, as they refracted the light into tiny beams of colors. 
	</p>
	<p>Beside him, Candentia did the same, not minding at all when her black fingerless gloves soaked up the dew drops.
	</p>
	<p>They walked at a rather hasty speed, out of habit, despite the peacefulness, and sped through the large maze of bushes, into yet another small grove, down the narrow lanes, and through the passageways that led to the other side. 
	</p>
	<p>The journey through the tall shrubs of green ended in no time, and the white and gray marble buildings of the upper part of the citadel soon came into view when they stepped out into the opening. The path, which the style had returned to the typical roads of the citadel, with small rectangular stones lining close together underneath their feet, ran towards the long steps that led up to the upper terrace where the R.A. departments, the royal library, and the Nix building were all situated.
	</p>
	<p>“Race you up the hill,” Aurelius said, smirking slightly— the competitive side of him resurfacing.
	</p>
	<p>Candentia laughed— her eyes glinting with mischief as she raced alongside Aurelius, leaping up the stone-paved stairs. 
	</p>
	<p>A young lad that sat at the top of the steps stood up when he heard their voices. With a hand cupped around his mouth, he called out to them; whole body swaying as he waved. His yellow hazel eyes that peeked out from under the fluffs of honey-brown hair shone with delight as Candentia and Aurelius dashed up to his side, both panting— lips parted and face flushed.
	</p>
	<p>“Did you wait long?” Candentia reached up and brushed his cheek. His skin felt cold under her warm fingers. Tsahn smiled, shaking his head slightly. 
	</p>
	<p>Tsahn turned and pulled his friends closer, draping his arms around both of their shoulders, “you both smell of flowers and fresh dew drops,” he chuckled softly, sniffing, “spring really has come.”
	</p>
	<p class="p">It was as if the fresh scent of lavender and roses still lingered in the air as Aurelius gradually opened his eyes. The bittersweet taste just at the tip of his tongue.
	</p>
	<p> Soft light slanted through the small slits of the spacious tent, hitting the dust particles so that they shimmered in a way that seemed as if time had stopped in its tracks. 
	</p>
	<p>“Aurie,” a childish voice of a little boy sounded. “You’re up! Come play with me!”
	</p>
	<p>Aurelius sat up and saw that Trias, the six year old, was peering at him from the side. 
	</p>
	<p>“Trias,” Aurelius murmured hazily. “Is it spring time already?” 
	</p>
	<p>“No, silly,” the little boy giggled, “it’s still snowing outside.”
	</p>
	<p>He then furrowed his eyebrows as he reached up for Aurelius’ cheeks, where two shimmering strands lined each side. 
	</p>
	<p>“Did you dream of something sad?”
	</p>
	<p>Aurelius flinched slightly and pushed the little hands away gently. 
	</p>
	<p>There was, in fact, a damp feeling of a trail that ran from the corner of his eyes to the side of his chin. He brushed his cheeks, bewildered.
	</p>
	<p>“Are you hurting?” the little boy, Trias, asked.
	</p>
	<p>“Don’t worry,” Aurelius said gently, as he placed a hand on the little one’s head, “I was just dreaming of some people I miss.”
	</p>
	<p>“People you miss?” Trais repeated, “who are those people?”
	</p>
	<p>“They are…” Aurelius thought for a moment, and replied softly, “family.”
	</p>
	<p>“Are they at your home, waiting for you to go back?” 
	</p>
	<p>“No, I can’t say they are.”
	</p>
	<p>“Why not? Are they like my moma and paba?” 
	</p>
	<p>“Yes, and no,” Aurelius said ever so gently, putting a hand on the child’s head.
	</p>
	<p>“Then when can you see them again?”
	</p>
	<p>Usually, Aurelius found most children agreeable, and quite pleasant to engage with. However, having just woken up, and hardly recovered from the sudden hit of nostalgia, he was overwhelmed by these drilling questions. 
	</p>
	<p>To Aurelius’ relief, Trias’ older sister came barging into the tent in no time, and grabbed the child from behind the neck. Her goat horns and ears were sticking out of her brown hair which was braided in the front and tied up in the back.
	</p>
	<p>“There you are,” she snarled at the six year old, “I thought I told you to wash your face.”
	</p>
	<p>“Lemme goooo!” Trias kicked, but his struggles were in vain. His sister’s grasp was far too strong for him to escape.
	</p>
	<p>“Stop bothering Aurelius!” she scolded him, “did I not teach  you any manners?”
	</p>
	<p>“Artties, you old witch!” Trias shouted as he got dragged out of the tent. His small horns had popped out from between his fluffy locks of brown hair, and his ears morphed into those of a goat.
	</p>
	<p>Aurelius chuckled as he locked eyes with Artties. 
	</p>
	<p>“Thanks,” he mouthed to her.
	</p>
	<p>The fourteen year old therianthrope gave Aurelius an apologetic smile, blushing, as she dragged her brother out through the fly-sheets.
	</p>
	<p>“It’s his last day here,” he heard her say, “so behave! Don’t you want him to remember us as good hosts?”
	</p>
	<p class="p">The highlands were still covered in layers of thick snow, and the air was dry and cold, with a fresh scent of pine wood. Thin threads of smoke slithered out from some of the underground stoves, swirling above the tents that lined the village; drifting up, up, up— until blending into the gray sky.
	</p>
	<p>“Good morning!” an old woman bleated. She was the Iatromantis of the clan, and lived just three tents away from Artties and Trias. The Iatromantis lived alone with a herd of goats, and was feared by most children, but respected by the others, for they relied on her skills to cure their diseases and discomforts. 
	</p>
	<p>“Good morning,” Aurelius replied as he took her baskets in his hand. The woven baskets were full of herbs and a creepy-looking flower.
	</p>
	<p>Aurelius stared at the flower. The pale petals and yellow pistil somehow formed the face of a goat, and the more he looked at it, the more it seemed to stare back.
	</p>
	<p>“You are a good lad,” the Iatromantis said, squinting at him through her wrinkles.
	</p>
	<p>“Thank you,” Aurelius smiled, “and you are a lovely lady.”
	</p>
	<p>She let out a raspy but hearty laugh— the sound similar to a happy goat. All the villagers of this particular clan laughed in this bizarre way, to which Aurelius hadn’t been used to at first, but after nearly a season of staying with the clan, he grew to be quite fond of it.
	</p>
	<p>Clan Fyuon was a rather large branch of the ungulate tribes, and had traveled the southern lands, following after water and grass. 
	</p>
	<p>Powered by mountain goats, the clan moved their residence every half to one season, living in portable tents. The tents, made with leather, were tall as they were wide. Aurelius found them quite warm and cozy.
	</p>
	<p>Before he met Artties, or rather, had been rescued by Artties, Aurelius had been travelling on foot for over ten days, making his way up the mountains. He had been heading south, towards the center of the southern land, which was where the realms of clan Syarchia lay. 
	</p>
	<p>Esen had given him a list of places that the search team had not yet covered, and Tsahn’s homeland had been one of them.
	</p>
	<p>According to Esen Ventus’ words, the southern lands were a rough place for them to tackle.
	</p>
	<p>First of all, the land itself was vast, with some of the environments not being the most friendly. Without thorough preparation and the right equipment, one could easily lose an arm or two.
	</p>
	<p>Secondly, there is an incalculable variety of ethnic groups, of which their culture is not fully understood by outsiders to this day. It was known that not all clans got along with each other, and would often fight for food and water. Given their respective vigilance, it would only be reasonable to assume their possible reactions to a sudden stranger.
	</p>
	<p>As for the mighty clan Syarchia, they are well known for their sharp-eyed patrollers and fierce warriors, definitely not making it the most ideal place for an undercover agent to visit.
	</p>
	<p>When considering the best candidate to take on the challenging role, Esen Ventus had named Tsahn Aouthyerhl as the perfect candidate. Unfortunately, the lad refused to participate in the operation. 
	</p>
	<p>With his first option gone, Ventus turned to his second best choice— Aurelius Solicas. Surely the clan wouldn’t mind if an old friend paid them a visit, wouldn’t they? And surely the general’s first son should be skillful enough to survive the hostile environments on his own, shouldn’t he?
	</p>
	<p>There was probably no other R.A. member that would be willing to take such a risk in sending Aurelius Solicas out on any dangerous missions. People feared what general Solicas might do if anything went wrong, but, with his options limited, Esen Ventus had no better choice than to trust the ability of his new “apprentice.” 
	</p>
	<p>Ventus’ judgment has been proven correct so far, for Aurelius not only survived the journey across the broad grasslands and a small desert, he had managed to stay in one piece even after running onto the people of several clans. 
	</p>
	<p>Most of the clans Aurelius encountered were kind enough to give him a chance to prove that he came in peace; those he sometimes dwelled with for a while. As for the ones that were far too wary of outsiders and chased after him, threatening to kill; those he rode away on his horse as fast as he could, until he left their territories.
	</p>
	<p>When Aurelius finally arrived at the foot of the mountains, two seasons had already passed. The trees were bare, preparing to welcome winter to the land. He traded his horse for some food and a winter cloak before setting foot in the forest. 
	</p>
	<p>It was the thirteenth day since he had been climbing when snow started to fall. 
	</p>
	<p>Winter came sooner than he had expected, and he realized that he would either starve, or freeze to death before he could reach his destination. To make matters worse, the snow turned unexpectedly into a blizzard in no time.
	</p>
	<p>With the trail covered, Aurelius relied on a vague map and his compass to find his direction. It slowed him down, and he knew that he could be in serious trouble if he did not make it to the highlands of Fyoun soon.
	</p>
	<p>The blizzard did stop eventually, but Aurelius felt as if the temperature was even lower than before, and that the only thing left, holding his body up, was his willpower. When he finally saw an opening ahead of him, it was already the sixth day that he hadn’t eaten. Before he could make it out of the woods, he felt himself gradually losing the last of his consciousness. 
	</p>
	<p>Being under such extreme physical exhaustion, starvation, or hypothermia, even Aurelius Solicas could not have survived all on his own.
	</p>
	<p>Through the blurriness of light, Aurelius saw someone rush towards him. He felt the small hands of a girl fling his arm around her own shoulder and led the way.
	</p>
	<p>“Who… are you?” Aurelius managed to say, his words slurring.
	</p>
	<p>“That’s what I should be asking,” the girl said, “who are you? And what are you doing in my clan’s territory?”
	</p>
	<p>“My name is Aurelius,” he replied weakly, “I am from Land Hyacinthous, and I come in peace.”
	</p>
	<p>“I’m Artties,” the girl said, “your temperature is too low. I’m taking you to my tent. Just how long were you out in the cold?”
	</p>
	<p>Aurelius was fully shivering, and was on the brink of giving in to the drowsiness when the girl Artties’ voice sounded again. 
	</p>
	<p>“Go away, Rantus.”
	</p>
	<p>“Who’s that?” a boy said roughly.
	</p>
	<p>“None of your business,” Artties said, tone fierce. “Get out of my way or else I’ll headbutt you in front of everyone else later.”
	</p>
	<p>“You’re not supposed to let strangers into our village,” Rantus grunted, although he stepped aside obediently.
	</p>
	<p>Artties ignored the boy and said to Aurelius, “we’re almost there, you have to stay awake. Try talking to me.”
	</p>
	<p>“What if he’s a bad guy?” Rantus called after them.
	</p>
	<p>“I’ll headbutt you, do you hear me?” Artties shouted back.
	</p>
	<p>“I smell porridge,” Aurelius mumbled. “It’s hot. Is it summer?”
	</p>
	<p class="p">The girl, Artties, was fourteen years old, and had nut brown hair and bright brown eyes. Her younger brother, Trias, had similar features and was six. The siblings lived together in the tent and often bickered about. 
	</p>
	<p>Aurelius found it amusing how their little goat ears would poke out through their brown strands with a puff, when they were either tired or emotional. 
	</p>
	<p>The pair of curious youngsters often pestered Aurelius with questions. Nevertheless, he enjoyed being in their presence, and was extremely grateful for the shelter they offered. 
	</p>
	<p>When Attries first brought Aurelius, who’s life was hanging by a thread at that time, into the village, the majority of the clan opposed the idea to let the stranger stay. They are wary of any outsiders, especially those who carry a sharp sword. 
	</p>
	<p>While Aurelius had been lethargic and not able to speak clearly, some suggested that they inspect the sword to determine his identity, but, with no carvings nor sigils found on the blade or its handle, it shed no light on the situation. If worse, it brought even more anxiety, for a sharp blade without a sigil is mostly a dangerous one, as a man with an intended hidden identity is mostly up to no good.
	</p>
	<p>The Iatromantis stepped in, unexpectedly, to Aurelius’ aid, and said in her wavering voice, that she felt nothing but goodwill from the stranger, and suggested they let him stay for a few days until he recovered. Most of the people eventually agreed, for they trusted the old woman and listened to her words with respect.
	</p>
	<p>Aurelius had woken up in Artties and Trias’ tent to find that his sword had been taken away for “safe keeping.” Although he felt slightly annoyed, he understood the worries of the people. And to Aurelius’ and Artties’ relief, most of the people of clan Fyoun started to take a liking towards Aurelius after a few days. 
	</p>
	<p>Word had spread out that the stranger was a polite young man and a diligent helper, as well as a rare sight for sore eyes. He was good at chopping wood, setting up fires, and surprisingly, weaving, and Artties often saw him helping about through the village. 
	</p>
	<p>“You’re making me proud,” Artties once said to Aurelius, when they huddled around the outer circle of the bonfires, with Trias and his buddies playing behind them. They were munching on some soup and bread while watching the other folks dance in the inner circle.
	</p>
	<p>“Am I?” the young man had said in his melodic voice. His smile was soft but mesmerizing, as the warm light of the fire lit up his face. 
	</p>
	<p>“Then I guess I must’ve done something right,” he said. The shadows of his eyelashes quivered as he raised his eyebrows at Artties in a playful way.
	</p>
	<p>“My people. They like you.”
	</p>
	<p>And before Aurelius could answer, a group of girls passed by.
	</p>
	<p>“Attety,” one of them called out to Artties. The girl was about twenty years old, and had black hair tied low to the side with two thin braids swinging on each side of her face. She was Artties’ favorite in the group, and Artties had her own hair done just like hers. 
	</p>
	<p>“If you run into Aurelius,” she said to Artties, knowing perfectly well that Aurelius was sitting right there, “can you tell him to put down that soup of his and come join the dance?” 
	</p>
	<p>Artties rolled her eyes at the older, but grinned.
	</p>
	<p>“You see?” she said to Aurelius, after the girls pranced away. “They like you.”
	</p>
	<p>Aurelius smiled and placed his bowl down.
	</p>
	<p>“Well,” he mused, “I guess they do.”
	</p>
	<p>He beckoned to her. “Come,” he said, “you’re not tossing me in there all by myself.”
	</p>
	<p>Artties laughed heartily as she, Aurelius and the others pranced to the beat; drawing circles around one another and bleating with delight. 
	</p>
	<p class="p">Despite his desire to stay, Aurelius set out on a clear day, resuming his journey towards clan Syarchia. 
	</p>
	<p>Trias and Artties had stood by the end of the village, sobbing, while waving goodbye to Aurelius until his figure disappeared into the distance. 
	</p>
	<p>Aurelius couldn’t help but glanced back to take in the view of the beautiful, snow-covered mountains as he descended down in the direction of Syarchia. It had not been an hour, and he was starting to miss Fyoun and its people already. He had to move on, though, for the calm skies and peaceful weather was not guaranteed. It would be a nightmare to end up as the last time he tried to tackle the cruel power of nature.
	</p>
	<p>With a fully rested body and mind, he went through the woods and thick snow rather steadily. It was not long until he reached the great hills and plateau of Syarchia, which were situated near the center of the southern lands, and surrounded by high mountains. 
	</p>
	<p>Three long and high screeches from above signaled his arrival into the territory of clan Syarchia. And as he stood there wondering whether he should announce himself, a large shadow swooped down. Aurelius looked up to see a falcon shooting straight towards him. He stood still and dared not move, a gesture that he came in peace, for he knew about the consequences of being viewed as an intruder to the clan.
	</p>
	<p>The large bird flapped its strong wings and extended its claws. And with a swift movement, it flung Aurelius’ hood off, revealing his face. 
	</p>
	<p>Aurelius held his breath when he felt the falcon’s sharp claws on his shoulders as it tried to perch there. He raised his arm and it jumped into it. Aurelius was glad that he had on a thick layer of clothing, or else the claws would have sunk into his skin. 
	</p>
	<p>The dark brown eyes of the falcon started into Aurelius’ amber ones for a moment. It gave his arm a hard push as it rose into the air again. As it did, Aurelius could hear the hissing of its wings, followed by two short screeches— then two more.
	</p>
	<p>Aurelius sighed with relief, as he gazed up at the bird that had climbed back up into the sky. 
	</p>
	<p><i>Thank goodness it was two that followed and not three.</i>
	</p>
	<p>The first two screeches meant that he was an outsider, and not a member of the clan, and the following two was that he did not show any behaviour of hostility towards the bird, which indicated that he <i>could</i> be friendly.
	</p>
	<p>If the following screeches had sounded three times, arrows would be showering on him.
	</p>
	<p>He stood there and waited, for he knew that the patrollers of the clan, either perching on treetops, or circling in the sky, would soon be coming.
	</p>
	<p>And sure enough, three larger shadows came at him from different directions. 
	</p>
	<p>Within seconds, Aurelius was surrounded.
	</p>
	<p>“Care to speak your name, and your intentions of entering the territory of clan Syarchia?” the Syarchian standing in front of him said. She was a tall woman with a sharp nose and thin lips. Her hair was tied up on the upper half while the lower half trimmed off. Her hands were on her knives, and her hazel eyes were watching Aurelius’ every movement.
	</p>
	<p>Aurelius held both hands in the air, palms open. 
	</p>
	<p>“I come in peace,” he said calmly, although his heart was pounding. “My name is Aurelius Solicas, and I am from the citadel of Land Hyacinthous.”
	</p>
	<p>The woman showed the top of one of her blades, and the eagle perched on a tree top behind her screeched loudly.
	</p>
	<p>“We were not told that any Hyacinthous diplomats would be visiting,” she snarled, “and you did not specify your intentions of your sudden appearance as I told you to.”
	</p>
	<p>“You did not give me a chance to explain,” Aurelius replied coldly. “I am not here on an official matter. But rather just passing by. I intend to make my way to the far-south shores.”
	</p>
	<p>“Just passing by?” 
	</p>
	<p>“Visiting the parents of a close friend of mine.”
	</p>
	<p>“And may I ask who is this close friend of yours?”
	</p>
	<p>“Tsahn Aouthyerhl.”
	</p>
	<p>At this, the woman stopped and looked at Aurelius with slight astonishment in her eyes. The other two patrollers seemed to also be surprised. 
	</p>
	<p>“I suppose you recognize my last name, Solicas?”
	</p>
	<p>The woman, however, gave a cold, short laugh and crossed her arms. “Yes, and as a matter of fact, now that you brought it up, the name you said just now— you are saying that you are general Solicas’ first son?”
	</p>
	<p>“Yes. I’m glad it rings a bell.”
	</p>
	<p>“I don’t believe him,” the Syarchian rear-right of Aurelius spoke up, his deep voice rumbling, “no way that a general’s son would be roaming alone on the lands without protection.”
	</p>
	<p>“Norst should be reporting back to see if there’s anyone else hiding out there anytime now,” the one rear-left of Aurelius said. He had a thin, cold voice, and he sounded younger than the other two. 
	</p>
	<p>“Take me to the chief or chieftess,” Aurelius said, “they might recognize me.”
	</p>
	<p>“As if saying that’ll get you past us,” the woman smirked. “Don’t you think it’s far too convenient for you, that the close friend you mentioned is not here to prove your identity?”
	</p>
	<p>Just as the last sentence ended, a swarm of swallows came swooping down, and a girl looking about Aurelius’ age landed on the ground beside the woman, toes pointed and left foot first, movements lithe. Her short skirt flowed up, revealing a pair of tight, gray leggings underneath. She had on a white tank-crop top, with a small “v” shape cut in the collar, and a sleeveless, swallowtail jacket, with the linen fabric swaying to the wind. Over her shoulders, a long black cloak with fur and feathers hung, which the sides attached to her wrists. She wrapped the cloak around her body as soon as she landed, shivering.
	</p>
	<p>“All clear,” she told the woman in a low but crisp voice.
	</p>
	<p>When she turned around, her dark, yellow hazel eyes widened.
	</p>
	<p>“I remember you,” she said slowly, studying Aurelius’ face, “you’re Tsahn’s friend from the centered land.”
	</p>
	<p>“And you’re Jrena,” Aurelius guessed, “Tsahn’s best friend.”
	</p>
	<p>If it weren’t for the incident of Tsahn’s nightmare at professor Coulnaur’s class a year ago, he would’ve almost forgotten what she looked like. She had changed a lot, with her features more sharp while multiple new piercings decorated her left ear. The only thing that still remained the same about her appearance should be her large hazel eyes and the small beauty spot beneath the edge of her left eyebrow.
	</p>
	<p>“I wouldn’t say that now,” Jrena Norst gave him a small smile, “it’s been a long time since we saw Tsahn in person.”
	</p>
	<p>Aurelius could feel the small sting in her voice, but chose to ignore it. He turned back to the tall woman.
	</p>
	<p>“I believe this should prove my identity?” 
	</p>
	<p>She shrugged and swatted her knives back into their sheaths. A tread of rhythmic high whistles cut through the air as she put two fingers in her mouth and blew hard.
	</p>
	<p>“Hand over your weapons, and we’ll take you to the chief,” she said to Aurelius. “Then we’ll see.”
	</p>
	<p>“I’ll do it!” Jrena volunteered. “I can take him. My swallows can carry his things.”
	</p>
	<p>“Very well.”
	</p>
	<p>The man standing rear right of Aurelius tossed Jrena a net. She caught it and flung in open on the ground.
	</p>
	<p>“All weapons and your outer clothings please,” she said, looking at Aurelius with a smile. 
	</p>
	<p>“Outer clothings?” Aurelius asked. 
	</p>
	<p>“Shut up and do as she says,” the young man with the thin voice said.
	</p>
	<p>Aurelius tossed him a small glare and tilted his head back at Jrena with a look of inquiry. Was he supposed to freeze to death? There should still be a long distance to the center of Syarchia where the base of the clan was situated. 
	</p>
	<p>“Now, now,” she said, laughing, “how are you going to fly with all that on.”
	</p>
	<p><i>“Fly?!”</i>
	</p>
	<p>“Don’t tell me you already forgot how to,” Jrena said, crestfallen. She definitely did not wish to walk all the way back. It would take up nearly a whole day, if they travelled fast enough. 
	</p>
	<p>She looked at her older colleagues. 
	</p>
	<p>“Anyone craving a long walk?”
	</p>
	<p>“You volunteered,” the taller man said with a laugh. “It looks like I won’t be needed here. I’ll be heading off.” He gave Jrena a pat on the shoulder as he headed towards the edge of the cliff they were standing on.
	</p>
	<p>“See you!” he called before diving off. 
	</p>
	<p>Aurelius watched in awe as the man’s figure appeared again as he held open his cloak, soaring away with his sparrowhawk mirroring his movements.
	</p>
	<p>“Like that,” Jrena gestured to Aurelius quite desperately. “Do you remember now?”
	</p>
	<p>“I suppose,” Aurelius shrugged and took off his cloak, his outer jacket, and fur vest, and folded them neatly on the net. He also handed over his long sword and two daggers that hung on his belt. The ones hidden in his clothes, however, he pretended that they didn’t exist.
	</p>
	<p>“My, oh my,” Jrena murmured, “just how much stuff you had been carrying?”
	</p>
	<p>“I prefer not to die,” Aurelius said, letting out a soft laugh.
	</p>
	<p>“Outer boots, too,” the young man said coldly. He had not budged since the beginning. Even though Aurelius disliked the tone, he did as he was told.
	</p>
	<p>“Is this goat suede I am touching?” Jrena asked, mesmerized, as she ran a hand down the soft fabric of Aurelius’ folded cloak. “Why? How? And this is made with Fyoun’s magic, which they do not share that easily. Did you kill someone for it?”
	</p>
	<p>“Jrena,” the woman cut in, “quit being distracted.”
	</p>
	<p>Jrena jumped up and whistled. The swallows reappeared from the branches behind and swooped around them. Jrena called out something in the midst of the chatter, and the birds grabbed on the sides of the net and carried Aurelius’ belongings away, towards the direction of the home base of Syarchia.
	</p>
	<p>“What now?” Aurelius asked, teeth chattering.
	</p>
	<p>Jrena ignored him and whistled towards the opening, the same tread of rhythmic high notes that the tall woman had done.
	</p>
	<p>The Syarchians looked at one another.
	</p>
	<p>“He <i>should</i> be here by now.”
	</p>
	<p>“Who?” Aurelius asked. 
	</p>
	<p><i>“Did I just walk into a trap?”</i> he thought desperately, <i>“am I really going to freeze to death this time?”</i>
	</p>
	<p>“There he is,” the young man said. And as they looked around, they could see another large shadow leaping out from under the cliff, and landing perfectly on the ground, while holding their arms out. 
	</p>
	<p>Aurelius saw that it was another young man, looking strikingly similar to Jrena. They even had mirroring ear piercings on one ear, with two small hoops on the helix, one stud on the upper lobe, and silver feather dangling next to the cheek from the long earring on the lobe, while the other ear had only one small hoop.
	</p>
	<p>A large bird flapped its wings as it dropped a bundle beside Jrena’s feet. The falcon circled back to the newcomer and perched proudly on his extended arm.
	</p>
	<p>“Good boy,” the young man praised his companion. 
	</p>
	<p>“What took you so long?” Jrena asked him as she handed the bundle to Aurelius.
	</p>
	<p>“The snow was too deep,” the young man answered as he glanced at Aurelius, “it took me longer than expected to dig it up. You’re lucky I even found it.”
	</p>
	<p>Aurelius inspected the feathery thing, and found that it was a long cloak, similar to what the Syarchians wore. He flung it around himself, the warmth bringing him back to life almost immediately.
	</p>
	<p>“Don’t tell me you guys took away his clothes at the first whistle,” the young man said, worried.
	</p>
	<p>“They did,” Aurelius chuckled as he took a step towards the other. “It’s good to see you again, Jrethian.”
	</p>
	<p>Jrethian Norst gave Aurelius a look of surprise and studied his face carefully. Realization hit him as he remembered the outsider— the face is a hard one to forget.
	</p>
	<p>“Aurie!” he exclaimed, “why, this is wild.”
	</p>
	<p>“Right! Aurie, short for Aurelius,” Jrena Norst hit her palm with a fist. “I remember your name now.”
	</p>
	<p>Aurelius grinned. “Just now?” he teased, “heartbreaker.”
	</p>
	<p>“Aww, come on,” Jrena said, “I’m just bad with names. Don’t expect too much from me.”
	</p>
	<p>“Are you guys going to chit chat all day?” the other young man said coldly.
	</p>
	<p>“He’s right,” the tall woman said, “you better set off now. We have other duties to do.”
	</p>
	<p>“Jrethian,” she called, “you go with your twin. Make sure she doesn’t stray from the path.”
	</p>
	<p>“Roger that.”
	</p>
	<p>“What? You <i>still</i> don’t trust me?” Jrena scowled..
	</p>
	<p>“You know I don’t,” the woman smirked before she took off, falling face up from the cliff, arms open wide, with the other Syarchian following after.
	</p>
	<p>It was in that way that Aurelius Solicas finally arrived at his destination, where he searched the lands for traces of Candentia by day, and stayed with the Norst twins in their treehouse at night. 
	</p>
	<p>Another seven days had passed and he found nothing, and decided that it was time that he head down the mountains to search another area.
	</p>
	<p> The chief and chieftess had both been kinder to him than he had thought they would be, and his bags were full of dried meat and nuts when he left to resume his journey.
	</p>
	<p class="p"> It was in the evening of the second day since he left the realms of Clan Syarchia, when he noticed that he had been followed. 
	</p>
	<p>He had caught a scent in the air, different from the dryness of the snow nor the dampness of the tree trunks. It was a living creature but supposedly not an animal in the wild. The scent of artificial clothing was different from that of natural fur in Aurelius’ opinion. 
	</p>
	<p>Has the person been following him for an hour? Or has it been a whole day until he noticed just now? He couldn’t tell. 
	</p>
	<p>The end’s of the hair on the back of his neck stood up as an unpleasant chill ran down his spine.
	</p>
	<p>The sun was just above the edge of the mountain tops, preparing to slip away any minute. It would be dangerous to set camp without knowing what he was to face in the darkness of the forest.
	</p>
	<p>He walked on as if nothing was wrong and observed— 
	</p>
	<p class="pend"> Judging by the directions of the winds and the denseness of the scent, his stalker should be close by. Despite the lack of hostility detected, Aurelius decided that it was time he did something.
	</p>
