	<h2 class="chapter title">Troubles and Trauma</h2>

<div class="chaptercontent">
	<p><b class="b">E</b>sen Ventus had already lost track of how much time was devoted to the new tasks at hand, and how many afternoons were contributed into the meetings held in the hidden war rooms. 
	</p>
	<p>The cracking of bones sounded as he stretched his arms and neck; a huge sigh slipped past his lips as he sat alone in his office, drowning in misery. 
	</p>
	<p>“So much for a promising future,” he murmured to himself.
	</p>
	<p>The warm lantern light flickered, and his reflection on the window quivered.
	</p>
	<p class="p">
	</p>
	<p>After the incident of the abduction of the first heir of Hyacinthous, the first mission Esen Ventus had been assigned to, was to join the negotiation squad. The squad, consisting of nine R.A. officials and led by general Solicas himself, was set to the island near the northern borders. Esen and two other second lieutenants of the R.W.D. flew along the borders outside of the boundary enchantment, searching for traces of their lost heir, while general Solicas and three other swordspersons stood watch as the remaining three members of the squad— enchanters, weaved communication spells (and threats), sending them into the realms of the north, requesting for their counterparts to send out diplomatics for further negotiation. 
	</p>
	<p>One week later, they received a reply. 
	</p>
	<p>“Welcome,” the spell imprinted on the smooth stone on the northern edge of the island had read.
	</p>
	<p>“We are honored— that the royal army, not mentioning a noble general himself, came all this way, just to have a conversation with us. We thought that it would be a shame if you left without a sight of our lands, thus, we invite you to cross the borders, to step in our realms for further discussion. If you were to refuse, we are afraid that there would be nothing we could do, but to continue to take good care of your princess until you agree to our only term— lift the boundary enchantment, once and for all.”
	</p>
	<p>As much as general Solicas wanted to barge right into the North, the king of land Hyacinthous instructed otherwise. Given his understanding of the Hellebore throne, and the fact that an ancient demon from the great war still resided on the foreign lands, he concluded it was not worth the risk of sacrificing his general and the officials for an uncertain outcome. 
	</p>
	<p>Lifting the boundary enchantment, however, was indeed out of the question, and the squad had returned to the citadel with nothing but disappointment and despair. The good news was that the North did provide a sign of life of the Hyacinth heir, while traces of the twenty year old’s powers were detected coming from within the Northern land.
	</p>
	<p>It hadn’t been a week into the new season when the citadel received the shocking news of the disappearance of not only the Hyacinth heir, but also the first son of the Hellebores. Nobody knew where the news came from, and how it started. Yet, the officials acted at once to determine the truth. 
	</p>
	<p>Esen Ventus had also been one of the officials in charge of conducting the search of Candentia Hyacinth from their headquarters at Annyo. Toiling away for yet another hard fourteen days, Esen and his fellow members of the search squad had come to the realization, with despair, that there was in fact, no traces of her powers left, and no signs that the Hyacinth’s first heir was alive anymore.
	</p>
	<p>With the return of general Sulvin, the daily Annyo post had described the recent circumstances with detail, declaring the possible death of Candentia Hyacinth, which caused quite a stir in Land Hyacinthous. The citadel had been shrouded with a solemn gloom for the past weeks, ever since the grave news broke out, and the frequent meetings regarding the search had come to an abrupt end. And just a few days later, a new operation had taken place, and preparations for the possibility of war against the North started, despite their denial of the accusations.
	</p>
	<p class="p">A knock sounded on his door, making Esen sit up, puzzled. It was late, and he hadn’t been expecting anyone. 
	</p>
	<p>“Who is it?” he asked, standing up, while one hand reached for his sword. 
	</p>
	<p>Nothing but more rapid knocks responded from the other side. He tilted his head, listening. Along the beats, Esen thought he made out a familiar rhythm and rushed across the room; stopped, however, just as he reached for the door— it couldn’t be possible. He sighed. It must’ve been his imagination. 
	</p>
	<p>“Who is it?” he asked again, wary, with one ear against the wooden door.
	</p>
	<p>“Lieutenant Ventus,” the muffled voice of a young girl sounded. “Please, it’s me, Aestas. Aestas Hyacinth,”
	</p>
	<p>And sure enough, the face of the second heir of Hyacinth appeared as Esen held the door open with a start. She had on a hooded cloak, and was glancing warily from side to side.
	</p>
	<p>“Dear princess,” he exclaimed softly with astonishment, “what brings you here at this time?”
	</p>
	<p>The sixteen year old slipped into the room as if in a hurry. “Please lock the doors,” she whispered. “No one can know that I’m here.”
	</p>
	<p>Alarms went off in his mind, but Esen still did as he was told.
	</p>
	<p>“You’re safe,” Esen Ventus hushed, as he watched the Hyacinth’s second heir pace around the room.
	</p>
	<p>“My apologies for this sudden appearance at a time so late,” she said with a sheepish smile, stopping in front of the young man, who had a sword in hand. She eyed the grayish green sheath of the long blade warily. Esen chuckled, and gave the blade a little lift, indicating that he had no intention of using it. 
	</p>
	<p>“You’ll get us both in trouble if someone finds out you’re here this late at night, dear princess,” he smiled. “And I don’t suppose it’s proper for you to be here alone with me.”
	</p>
	<p>Aestas let the hood fall behind her, revealing her whole face.
	</p>
	<p>“Please,” she said, hand clasped in front of her chest, as she gazed up at the young lieutenant imploringly. The black eyes of the man reminded her of the dark midnight sky.
	</p>
	<p>“Keep it a secret for me?” Aestas pleaded, “I had no choice. I couldn’t risk anyone knowing.”
	</p>
	<p>Something shifted in Esen’s eyes, as his gaze grew dark— the words reminded him of a certain someone that he realized suddenly that he missed more than he thought. With a soft sigh, Esen gestured to the long couch on the side of his office.
	</p>
	<p>“Please have a seat,” he said, surrendering, “and how do I owe the pleasure of your visit?” 
	</p>
	<p>Aestas giggled softly and plopped down. “My sister trusted you,” she said, settling into a comfortable position.
	</p>
	<p>Esen raised an eyebrow, startled by the sudden mention of a sensitive subject. “Yes,” he replied with bluntness, amused, “I believe she did.”
	</p>
	<p>Aestas fumbled with her cloak, and looked up at the young man with determination. “I have something to ask of you, lieutenant Ventus,” she said.
	</p>
	<p>Esen gulped, averting his eyes. He recognized the look, and a bad feeling crept up his chest. “Please do tell,” he said, nonetheless, “it would be my pleasure to assist you in any way I can.”
	</p>
	<p>“However,” he added, figuring that it is best to be honest with the young lady, “if this is about any secret missions, dear princess, I’m afraid I might not be able to help you. Not in this grave time.”
	</p>
	<p>“But you haven’t even heard what I was about to say!” Aestas protested anxiously, pouting.
	</p>
	<p>Esen tilted his head and glanced back at her. “Is it not about a secret mission, then?”
	</p>
	<p>“Well,” she nibbled her lower lip, “actually, yeah— it is—”
	</p>
	<p>The sword was placed on the desk with a clunk.
	</p>
	<p>“But it’s about my sister— Candentia—” Aestas blurted out in a hurry before the brunette could reply. 
	</p>
	<p>Esen shifted visibly with discomfort; black eyes glistening with uncertainty as he sat down on the edge of the desk, arms crossed. “What about her?” he asked, tone light, trying to hide the pain in his voice.
	</p>
	<p>“I don’t believe that she is stuck in the North, nor dead,” Aestas said, delivering her sentence word by word. The young man froze and looked at Aestas with astonishment. Her lime green eyes gleamed in the candle light. 
	</p>
	<p>The astonished gaze of Esen Ventus soon turned into sympathy and sorrow, and he tore his eyes away from the young Hyacinth. He couldn’t imagine the pain Aestas Hyacinth must’ve been under.
	</p>
	<p>“No,” Aestas blurted out, understanding the look, “it’s not because I’m grieving or that I am in denial.” She detested the look of pity.
	</p>
	<p>“I am long past that phase.”
	</p>
	<p>Esen merely blinked with hesitation.
	</p>
	<p>“It is true,” Aestas emphasized, “I had accepted the fact that she may never be back again. I understand that no traces of her powers have been detected and that my older sister might be dead. But the North claims that she is still alive and well.”
	</p>
	<p>“I have a lot of theories,” Aestas went on, “but in conclusion, I am wagering that something happened, and my sister, dead or alive, somehow ended up outside the borders of the North. They claim that she is well, but our enchanters found no trace of life left. There must be something going on, and I need to know. Even if it means finding out that she might have ended up dead, I need to know.”
	</p>
	<p>“There will be diplomatic meetings with the North upon the following season,” Esen said, dark brows furrowed, “the King had instructed that we find out the truth during the formal events. And that all searches be paused in fear of infuriating the North.”
	</p>
	<p>“That’s the point!” Aestas cried, trying to keep her voice down, “all searches had been stopped. How is she going to survive alone out there if she made it out alive? And even if she is—” she took another deep breath, “ —is dead. The least we should do is to find and retrieve her body.” Aestas trembled.
	</p>
	<p>“Dear,” Esen said, voice hushed, “there’s still the possibility that the North is telling the truth.” The sentence was also spoken for himself to hear.
	</p>
	<p>“As long as I wish the North’s statement to be true, I doubt that they are trustworthy,” Aestas said through gritted teeth.
	</p>
	<p>“One could never trust the north,” Esen agreed with a sigh, “they have their obvious reasons for deceit. But— I don’t reckon there’s anything we could do but wait, negotiate on their terms and find out.”
	</p>
	<p>“But if she is neither dead or captive,” Aestas said, “we must act! And if my father isn’t going to send out any search teams in the meantime, I need your help!”
	</p>
	<p>Esen shook his head gently. “The king— your father, has put a halt to the investigations, considering all factors,” he replied, “and it is his final decision, and it is not without reason, I’m afraid.”
	</p>
	<p>“Lieutenant Ventus,” the girl pleaded. 
	</p>
	<p>Esen Ventus knelt down, coming face to face with the sixteen year old, his black eyes reflecting the pain that was held in her lime green ones. 
	</p>
	<p>“As much as I yearn to help,” he whispered, “it would almost be impossible for me to act without getting myself into serious trouble. It would be defying the king’s direct orders, after all.”
	</p>
	<p>“What about <b>my</b> orders?” Aestas rasped, “I am also a Hyacinth, too, you know? And possibly the only heir left.”
	</p>
	<p>Esen stood up straight and ran a hand through his brown strands. His silence spoke loud.
	</p>
	<p>“Please!” Aestas cried softly.
	</p>
	<p>“You’re putting me into a difficult position here, dear,” Esen chuckled dryly. Although part of him agreed with the young Hyacinth, the sensible voice in his mind warned him to pay heed to the king’s orders. 
	</p>
	<p>“Please don’t take it to heart,” he said rather flushed, realizing how crestfallen the young Hyacinth seemed to be. She sat there in silence, tense, as her eyelids fluttered rapidly, in an attempt to keep the tears from escaping. How must’ve she suffered for the past season. Esen Ventus felt wretched upon her fragile state.
	</p>
	<p>“Is there anything else I can help you with?” he asked softly, “anything?”
	</p>
	<p>Aestas shook her head and stood up; flinging the hood back on, covering her teary face. “Thank you for letting me in, anyways,” she said, voice choking up.
	</p>
	<p>“Dear princess,” Esen murmured apologetically.
	</p>
	<p>The young girl rubbed her own eyes rather harshly.
	</p>
	<p>“May I escort you back to the Nix?” Esen asked carefully, his heart tearing at the sight. He did wish he could do something. 
	</p>
	<p>“I’ll be alright,” Aestas refused.
	</p>
	<p>“Let me take you back,” Esen insisted, nevertheless, “It’s far too late for you to roam outdoors by yourself.”
	</p>
	<p>“Come on, dear princess,” he coaxed softly, “and maybe we can find some other thing to work on.”
	</p>
	<p>Aetsas sniffled. “Fine,” she said, “but beware—” she grinned through her tears, “I will still pester you about the matter.”
	</p>
	<p>Esen smiled back as the young girl slipped past him, out of his office. “Well,” he said softly, “do have mercy.”
	</p>
	<p class="p">“That’s it. I’m going out to find her,” Aurelius stood up.
	</p>
	<p>“Wait!” Tsahn turned around hastily, hands still cupped on the window, “but you don’t know where she went.”
	</p>
	<p>“I’ll report to the R.A. and have the guards search the grounds,” Aurelius furrowed his eyebrows, heading towards the door.
	</p>
	<p>“No, Aurelius. Don’t—” Tsahn jumped up and grabbed him, “that would raise too much chaos. We can’t do that. The kingdom is overly sensitive right now, after what happened with Candentia.” 
	</p>
	<p>Aurelius grimaced at the name. “That’s exactly the very reason we need to search for her immediately!” he exclaimed, “how could you be so calm after what happened with…” he fell silent, unable to say the name. “Why isn’t Aestas under more heavy protection?” he asked instead, after a long pause.
	</p>
	<p>“She has been,” Tsahn explained. “She must’ve slipped out again after curfew. It’s the only time she’s not under surveillance”
	</p>
	<p>“What do you mean— slipped out again?” Aurelius furrowed his eyebrows. “Again? Does she do this often? How can you let her?” 
	</p>
	<p>“How can <b><i>I</i></b> let her?” Tsahn repeated, “what do you expect of me? It’s not my place to do anything! And besides, even if I could, I wouldn’t.”
	</p>
	<p>“Why?”
	</p>
	<p>“It’ll only vex the child!”
	</p>
	<p>“Child? She’s <i>sixteen</i> for goodness sake, Tsahn. I believe she should be mature enough to understand her responsibilities of being the only heir left of the land.”
	</p>
	<p>“The pressure would possibly suffocate her!” Tsahn exclaimed, recalling how Aestas had always reacted to being confined to the citadel. 
	</p>
	<p>“So be it!” Aurelius said through clenched teeth. “It’s her safety that matters the most.”
	</p>
	<p>“What about her happiness?”
	</p>
	<p>“Do you really suppose any one of us still holds the leisure for any happiness left?” Aurelius let out a cold laugh. “I didn’t expect you of all people to get over her death so easily.”
	</p>
	<p>“Will you stop that?” Tsahn hissed.
	</p>
	<p>“Stop what, exactly?”
	</p>
	<p>“Stop saying that she’s dead!” Tsahn answered with contained anger, “her body is not found yet. And before that happens, I’m not believing her death. It’s not time to give her up just yet.”
	</p>
	<p>“That’s not how it works, Tsahn” Aurelius said, voice laced with pain. “Not finding the body doesn’t mean that she’s not dead.”
	</p>
	<p>“Shut up,” Tsahn growled, grabbing Aurelius by the collar, “you better stop talking before I lose it.”
	</p>
	<p>“You have to spare me from that suffering hope of yours, Tsahn,” Aurelius whispered, “I can’t afford to delude myself any further. I’m not like you and Aestas. I can’t.”
	</p>
	<p>The door of the Nix opened however, and the guards saluted as Aestas Hyacinth slipped in. 
	</p>
	<p>Tsahn released his grasp immediately. “Where were you?” he asked, marching over. Aestas jumped and glanced behind her hastily. Lieutenant Ventus seemed to have already slipped away from sight, fortunately.
	</p>
	<p>“Nowhere,” she answered sheepishly.
	</p>
	<p>“Was that Esen Ventus?” Aurelius asked as he came up behind Tsahn, arms crossed.
	</p>
	<p>“How did you—” Aestas froze. “Well, no?”
	</p>
	<p>“Don’t try. I know it’s him,” Aurelius chuckled coldly, “care to explain?” He recognized the fresh scent that resembled the ocean. Candentia had often brought with her a whiff of blue cypress and sandalwood, whenever she returned from whatever secret meetings held in Esen Ventus’ office. 
	</p>
	<p>“Well?” Aurelius tilted his head at the younger, gazing at her like a tiger that had trapped its prey. Aestas fumbled with her dress, growing nervous— slightly frightened, memories of her older sister flashing across her mind. The once soft, buttery yellow linen was already wrinkled up on the sides like a dried up lemon.
	</p>
	<p>“Care to make use of that sweet voice now, hun?” Aurelius pressed. “What <i>was</i> your deal with Ventus?”
	</p>
	<p>“Cut her some slack,” Tsahn hushed under his breath as he held Aurelius back, “you’re scaring her.”
	</p>
	<p>Aestas shot Tsahn a grateful smile, her spirits rising up a little. The peacefulness in her heart didn’t last long, however, when Aurelius’ words pulled her back under. “I just don’t want her to end up like her sister,” he muttered.
	</p>
	<p>It was like an unintentional punch in the stomach, resulting in Aestas stumbling a few steps back.
	</p>
	<p>“I am not her!” she cried softly.
	</p>
	<p>“Hey,” Tsahn coaxed softly when he noticed how Aestas’ face seemed to crumble. “Hey, Aestas!” His voice was gentle, “Aurie is just looking out for you, okay?” 
	</p>
	<p>Aestas pushed past the boys. “It’s none of any of your business.”
	</p>
	<p>“And just to make it clear,” she said, pausing mid-way up the staircase. Her voice rang out through the marbled halls, her stance an imitation of the lost heir without realization. “I am not my sister. And I will never be. You both have to stop treating me as if I am the substitute for her, and leave me be.” 
	</p>
	<p>And she stormed off, disappearing out of sight.
	</p>
	<p class="p">Aurelius lay silently under the starry sky, chewing over what Aestas Hyacinth had said. He knew deep down that the girl was nothing like her older sister, but still— there were times when their tone and expressions would overlap, and the fear of losing someone again would clench his throat. 
	</p>
	<p>“This reminds me of when we were little,” Tsahn said quietly, as he gazed at his extended hand, which was nothing but a dark shadow that blocked his view of the stars at the moment. He sighed. Aurelius, Candentia and him had often climbed to the Nix’s rooftop when they were younger, and lay here— in hopes of catching glimpses of shooting stars.
	</p>
	<p>“I wonder if Cadenty is gazing up at the sky right now,” Tsahn went on, “the autumn night sky had always been her favorite, hadn’t it?”
	</p>
	<p>“Can you stop with the assumption?” Aurelius begged softly, “and the mention of—” he still couldn’t bring himself to say her name. The mere thought of her was gut-wrenching.
	</p>
	<p>The constellations of the autumn nights had a shimmering elegance to their glow, although its brightness nothing compared to the flamboyance of the summer night skies. Aurelius remembered how Candentia had pointed up to the sky, in the direction where the outline of a Tovik could be seen, with its cat-like ears pointing out the direction of the North, and the bushy tail to the sacred mountains of Dekota. 
	</p>
	<p>Aurelius was around thirteen years old when the trio first climbed up to the spot, and lay head to head, in a circle on the rooftop. The eyes of the Tovik constellation were shining just as radiantly as it was in the moment.
	</p>
	<p>“Those two jewel-like stars,” Candentia had pointed out that night, her voice hushed, “are said to be the lost sapphires of the ruler of the spirits.”
	</p>
	<p>“Which two?” Tsahn asked.
	</p>
	<p>“Those two,” Aurelius pointed out his finger, “the yellow ones that make up the eyes of the Tovik.”
	</p>
	<p>“There,” Candentia adjusted Tsahn’s arm with her small hands, into the correct direction. “Do you see it now?”
	</p>
	<p>And sure enough, there were the two brightest stars of the autumn night sky gazing down at them. It was not until then did Tsahn recognize the constellation Candentia was gushing about. “Yes,” he exclaimed with subtle excitement, “so that is what a Tovik really looks like.” 
	</p>
	<p>“No, actually we don’t know for sure,” Candentia informed, “no one has really seen them.”
	</p>
	<p>“But there are documentaries of their appearance in the Northern mountains of Dekota, and in the forests of the great North,” Aurelius said, as he gently bumped Candentia’s head with his own. “Although they are said to be quite vicious, Cadi here wants to have one as a pet.”
	</p>
	<p>Candentia had laughed— a soft sound of the whispering breeze.
	</p>
	<p>“That’s true, although I do know it’s nearly impossible,” she said, “Toviks cannot be tamed, not mentioning how I would have to be lucky enough to see one first. The books described them as such magical and mysterious creatures!”
	</p>
	<p>“We will go search for them someday,” Aurelius gushed, “and all other magical creatures as we sail the world!”
	</p>
	<p>“The world? Aurie, you are dreaming big,” Candentia giggled, “care for me and Tsahn to join?”
	</p>
	<p>“That goes without saying,” Aurelius replied, smiling up into the greatness of the vast, shimmering sky. “It will be the three of us, against the world.”
	</p>
	<p class="p">“Aurie,” Tsahn finally spoke again, after a long silence.
	</p>
	<p>Aurelius hummed in response.
	</p>
	<p>Tsahn sat up and took a deep breath, glancing down at the lad beside him. Under the starlight, he could see that Aurelius’ arms were tucked under his head, and he had his eyes open— gazing in the direction of the Tovik constellation.
	</p>
	<p>“I—” Tsahn started. His hesitation caught Aurelius’ attention.
	</p>
	<p>“I’m listening—” Aurelius urged softly as he shifted his body, folding his hands on his stomach. His eyes met Tsahn’s.
	</p>
	<p>Tsahn stared at him for a moment before starting again— “I thought about what you said earlier, and why I am so keen about believing that Candentia might still be alive.” He glanced at Aurelius’ folded hands, which were clenched tight in anguish, veins visible. Tsahn gulped and glanced back— the dark eyes were still trained on him, waiting for his explanation.
	</p>
	<p>“Just as you can’t afford to raise your hopes up,” Tsahn said, “I can’t afford to face the truth. Call me delusional if you want, but you have to understand that it is all I have left.”
	</p>
	<p>Aurelius stared back into the dark and said nothing. He could hear Tsahn’s small sniffle in the deep silence.
	</p>
	<p class="p"><b>“‘Hope’</b> is all I have left, Aurie,” Tsahn repeated, “and it is what Aestas has left, as well.”
	</p>
	<p>To be honest, the recent incidents were starting to get on her nerves— the topics regarding the lost heir were all the city was ever talking about. Initially, they were like sharp cuts through her heart, reminding her of the burning reality; but after a while, the pain grew numb, and every mention of “the lost heir” only added fuel to her irritation towards the situation. 
	</p>
	<p>Aestas had just returned to the Nix, after another exhausting afternoon at the main castle, only to find that Tsahn and Aurelius were in a sword fight. She watched with appreciation at first, taking notes of their brilliant skills, as well as the complicated moves and countermoves. However, as the fight got more intense, she noticed that something was wrong. With their eyes gleaming with hostility, the usual friendly competition was flowing with a dangerous atmosphere— it was as if they wanted to hurt each other. Fear rose in her as flashbacks of the fights of her parents overlapped with the sight. 
	</p>
	<p>Aurelius had been visiting the Nix far more frequently, ever since that night of Aestas’ sixteenth birthday. His presence somehow brought a sense of calmness to the residence, giving both Aestas and Tsahn a peace of mind. However, from the day news broke out that Candentia had disappeared from the surface of Csettrecsran, the air he wore grew tense. And to Aestas’ dismay, quarrels between Tsahn and the golden boy started breaking out. Never did they get into physical fights, however, despite the tension they held in their glares.
	</p>
	<p>“No!” Aestas shrieked out when Aurelius’ blade was just about to fall on Tsahn’s shoulder. She peeked through her fingers and saw that Tsahn had blocked the blade with his arm, while his own blade cut deep into the skin of the other.
	</p>
	<p>“Both of you, drop your weapons this instant!” Aestas cried at the sight of blood, and dashed over, almost tripping over her dress in the process.
	</p>
	<p class="p">“What were you thinking? Barging into the middle of a sword fight like that,” Aurelius said, as he let Aestas tend to his wounded arm. He hissed slightly at the sting when Aestas dabbed the cut with a damp linen cloth rather harshly. 
	</p>
	<p>“What were <i>you</i> thinking?” Aestas retorted, “trying to hurt Tsahn like that.” 
	</p>
	<p>Tsahn, on the other side of the room, let out a low chuckle. “Seems like I got the princess on my side,” he smiled smugly at Aurelius.
	</p>
	<p>Aurelius threw Tsahn a long strap of clean cloth. “Shut up and patch up,” he muttered, “you would’ve gotten cut if you didn’t put your arm in front of the blade like that.”
	</p>
	<p>“Just to let you chop off my shoulder?”
	</p>
	<p>“No!” Aurelius shot him a look, “did you really think that I would hurt you intentionally? I was going for the blunt side of the sword.”
	</p>
	<p>“As if it were my fault…” Tsahn muttered angrily, “how could I have known? You looked as if you wanted me dead.” The old cloth that wrapped around Tsahn’s left arm was slightly tinted with blood, and he tore it off, revealing a rather small cut. It seems like the general’s son did go easy on him.
	</p>
	<p>“Keywords— ‘looked as if,’” Aurelius glared at him, “while you, dear friend, on the other hand, really <i>did</i> want me dead, didn’t you?” 
	</p>
	<p>Tsahn gulped as he eyed the other, who gestured at the cut on his forearm, which was deep and oozing with blood. He actually was under the impression that Aurelius might be filled with enough rage to hurt him, and had flung out his arm while swinging his sword, reacting with instinct. “Minimize the degree of possible injuries,” as Lieutenant Baykartte had taught him, “and hit the enemy with a blow hard enough to knock them out, or better, kill them.”
	</p>
	<p>“You sure learned a skill or two,” Aurelius said, when Tsahn didn’t answer. 
	</p>
	<p>“Sorry,” Tsahn apologized, to which Aurelius shook his head.
	</p>
	<p>“No, it’s a good thing, actually,” he said with a small smile, “it means that you won’t need me here at the Nix as often.” He got up with a quiet grunt. “Thanks,” he added to Aestas, who sat there with a somewhat indescribable look on her face. Aurelius stopped and glanced from Tsahn to Aestas, sensing that something was wrong.
	</p>
	<p>“What did I do to offend you two?” he asked.
	</p>
	<p>“Nothing,” Aestas said, and stalked out of the room with the first aid kit in hand.
	</p>
	<p>“Was it something I said?” she heard Aurelius ask.
	</p>
	<p>“You basically told us that you were here, not because you cared for her, but rather because you don’t trust me enough to protect her,” was Tsahn’s answer.
	</p>
	<p>“You know that is <b><i>not</i></b> what I meant,” Aurelius protested.
	</p>
	<p>“Well, it sure sounded like it,” Tsahn replied, his tone growing colder at every word.
	</p>
	<p>“It’s not that I don’t trust you,” Aurelius tried to explain, “but if I were being honest, you haven’t been the strongest since we were kids.”
	</p>
	<p>“Wow, thanks for your honesty,” Tsahn said sarcastically, “that did not hurt at all.”
	</p>
	<p>“You’re starting to sound like her,” Aurelius muttered, as he watch Tsahn play with the silver dagger that was previously in the glass compartment under the table. It was one of Candentia’s old weapons that she had left behind, which only Aestas Hyacinth and Tsahn Aouthyerhl had access to. The bright blue sapphires on the handle glistened as Tshan pulled the short blade out of its black leather sheath.
	</p>
	<p>“I’ll take that as a compliment,” Tsahn hissed.
	</p>
	<p>The air was heavy when Aestas slipped back into the room. Both Tsahn and Aurelius looked as if they were about to jump into another fight.
	</p>
	<p>“Can you at least lighten up your mood?” Tsahn said coldly as he put down the dagger, not noticing Aestas’ presence. The blade left a crisp clink on the counter. 
	</p>
	<p>“Trying to smile in front of Aestas is the least we can do,” he hissed. Tsahn was talking to Aurelius, though his words somehow cut through Aestas. Just how weak and fragile did they consider her to be?
	</p>
	<p>“Smile?” Aurelius echoed, “how could any one of us smile as if nothing had happened?” his tone was stiff, “her sister, your betrothed, my friend, is dead, for all I know. And I’m sorry for not being able to forge a smile in front of both of you.”
	</p>
	<p>“And do you know how much guilt you are bringing on the poor child by throwing your gloom out and about?” Tsahn said, “with your cold attitude these days, Aestas thinks you blame her for what happened!”
	</p>
	<p>“Can you both just forget about Candentia for once?” Aestas blurted out. “She’s gone. Dead or alive— whatever. Just drop the subject, please. I’m sick of all of it.”
	</p>
	<p>Even with her sister gone, it felt as if the pressure and comparison had not been relieved from her shoulders, if not, it seemed to become worse. Wherever she went, everyone was asking about Candentia Hyacinth. Is she alive? Where is she? What happened? Did she sacrifice herself to save her little sister? Nobody cared to ask Aestas how she was feeling, and if she’s alright. 
	</p>
	<p>Aesats let out a fake laugh, trying to lighten up the mood, but the words that slipped out her lips were nothing but sour—
	</p>
	<p>“It’s like the pressure she forced on me louder than ever,” Aestas said scornfully, “I’m so sick and tired of everyone saying that she sacrificed herself for me and how I should be grateful.”
	</p>
	<p>“If it’s going to be like this, she better be gone for good. Then maybe then will someone see me as <b><i>me</i></b> for once.”
	</p>
	<p>“What did you say?” Aurelius’ voice was cold, but it made Aestas’ blood boil. She adored the gentle Aurelius, and tolerated his cold tone— as long as it wasn’t used on her.
	</p>
	<p>“I’m just speaking the truth!” she cried out, “at least I could say what’s on my mind, unlike the rest of you.”
	</p>
	<p>“That’s enough,” Aurelius started, “she <i>did</i> sacrifice herself, you know.”
	</p>
	<p><i>“Oh, Aurilius, we both know that’s bullshit,”</i> she glared at him through teary eyes, “she just wanted to do everything herself, even if she lacked the ability to get it done.”
	</p>
	<p>Aurelius took a deep breath, he was in such a deep rage that he was shaking, but he bit his lip and kept silent.
	</p>
	<p>“You’re just like Candentia, just like everyone else,” Aestas cried, “just leaving me to cope with everything on my own.”
	</p>
	<p>“Come on, don’t just stand there! At least show me your anger!” she threatened, blinded by her own rage that she even forgot who she was screaming at. She just couldn’t contain the pain anymore.
	</p>
	<p>“Aestas,” Tsahn said calmly, reminded suddenly of the day Candentia’s disappearance from the North was announced. “We’ve been here before. Calm down and let me handle this,” he coaxed, afraid that the sixteen year old would dash out into the woods again.
	</p>
	<p>Aesats flung herself at Tsahn and sobbed violently into his chest. He patted her on the back. Aurelius watched the scene unfold before his eyes with disbelief.
	</p>
	<p>“Replacing her so early on, I see,” he muttered with distaste, “do you have any shame.”
	</p>
	<p>“You seriously need to let go of that obsession of yours,” Tsahn snarled, to which Aestas shuddered. It was rare to see the gentle lad being this furious.
	</p>
	<p>A low growl rumbled from Aurelius’ throat. “There’s no obsession,” he denied, “just mere understanding that neither of us can escape the responsibility.”
	</p>
	<p>“That’s just torturing ourselves,” Aestas said, peeking back at Aurelius, whose burnt amber eyes were dark, filled with furry. She winced and buried her face back into the comfort of Tsahn’s cloak.
	</p>
	<p>“You should’ve let me go back to her that night,” Aurelius’ low voice sounded from above, calmer than ever, “then maybe none of this would’ve happened.”
	</p>
	<p>“You know that by doing so, Aestas would’ve followed you! And who knows what would’ve happened!”
	</p>
	<p>“That’s just an excuse,” Aurelius scorned.
	</p>
	<p>“No, it’s not.”
	</p>
	<p>“If you are sorry about what happened, then you should at least act like it.”
	</p>
	<p>“Aurie— I am sorry,” Tsahn pleaded, “you know I am. You know how much she means to me.”
	</p>
	<p>Aurelius’ gaze darkened.
	</p>
	<p>“She was his betrothed!” Aestas cried in a weak voice, “don’t you understand, Aurelius? If anyone could be more devastated than I am, it would be Tsahn. So can you leave us alone, and stop with this torturing of yours?
	</p>
	<p>“Ahh, that’s right…” Aurelius said softly, “with her gone, you won’t be able to maintain your status here.”
	</p>
	<p>“You know that’s not—”
	</p>
	<p>“Well, come to think of it, even with her gone, you might still get to marry into the throne.”
	</p>
	<p>“...what was that?”
	</p>
	<p>“Is that why she’s clinging on you so tight?” Aurelius pointed at Aestas, who still had her face half buried in Tsahn’s chest. 
	</p>
	<p>“That’s extremely messed up, Aurelius. You know she’s just a little sister,” Tsahn snarled, “you better keep your pretty mouth shut.”
	</p>
	<p>“Am I wrong, though?” Aurelius growled back, “you are still the Syarchia prince after all. You have your duty to social climb the way. Nothing’s changed.”
	</p>
	<p>Tsahn pushed Aestas aside and leapt forward, seizing Aurelius by the collar with both hands.
	</p>
	<p>“You—” he breathed, his yellow hazel eyes narrowed to slits as he glared into the burning amber ones.
	</p>
	<p>“Stop!” Aestas tried to put herself in between the two. “Stop—” she sobbed, “I’m sorry. I’m sorry. It’s all my fault. I apologize, so don’t fight like this.”
	</p>
	<p>Tsahn only grasped on harder, causing Aurelius to choke. “How could you of all people say that to me—” he trembled. And with a thud, Aurelius was slammed onto the wooden table. 
	</p>
	<p>“Just so you know,” Aurelius chuckled dryly, “I am concerned about you, Tsahn. With the first heir of Hyacinth gone, I fear for your safety at the citadel. It’s not only Aestas I’m looking after.”
	</p>
	<p>Tsahn looked coldly down on the raven-hair lad and stated coldly, “you are mistaking these actions of yours as means to make up for your regrets of letting Candentia go that easily. I’m not her, nor is Aestas, so save your fondness for someone else. And as you see, I’m perfectly capable of protecting Aestas alone. Neither one of us are damsels in distress, therefore, it would be better if you shove that hero complex of yours somewhere else.”
	</p>
	<p>“...I’m sorry you had to say that,” Aurelius said, as he hauled himself back up, one hand rubbing his own neck. He coughed, “you should be glad we’ll never see… her… again now that she’s dead—”
	</p>
	<p>“She is <b>not</b> dead!” Tsahn cut in, his voice raised, “for the hundredth time, can you just stop saying that?!”
	</p>
	<p>“Well, just as her dear sister Aestas here said— she better be,” Aurelius said coldly, ignoring Tsahn’s statement, “or else what will she think of her sister, of me, of you, and of all of this? I’m glad she isn’t alive to witness us in this miserable state.”
	</p>
	<p>“Get out,” Tsahn said, his voice quivering, “get out of the Nix.”
	</p>
	<p>“And here I thought you wanted me to stay,” Aurelius sneered.
	</p>
	<p>“Get out,” Tsahn growled, “I don’t want to see you again!”
	</p>
	<p>He pulled out the dagger that was previously on the table and hurled it at Aurelius, which made Aestas shriek in terror. 
	</p>
	<p>Aurelius dodged the weapon, but the look in his eyes was as if he had been stabbed multiple times in the chest. He took one last glare at Tsahn and turned away without saying a word. 
	</p>
	<p class="pend"> Shaking with horror, Aestas watched through the blurriness of her tears, as Aurelius Solicas stalked out of the Nix and never came back.
