	<h2 class="chapter title">The eye of the storm</h2>

<div class="chaptercontent">
	<p><b class="b">F</b>ae Baykartte squinted her eyes towards the faraway waters. 
	</p>
	<p>The surface of the inner seas of land 
	</p>
	<p>Hyacinthous sparkled marvelously upon contact with the gaudy rays of the evening sun.
	</p>
	<p>She was on the top platform of the wind tower, sitting at the edge and swinging her legs. The capital of Land Hyacinthous spread out far down below her feet. It was a forbidden place, yet her favorite spot in Annyo city, with a perfect view of the inner seas and the burning sunset. 
	</p>
	<p>She <i>was</i> going to say that no one ever intruded, but recently, there was one windrider that often showed up unexpectedly, barging onto her personal space. Fae vaguely remembered the first time she and the said windrider met, but they had become quite close throughout the events of the past year. Last summer, after the other’s promotion, they ended up being in the same position, both second lieutenants, and had somehow been assigned to the squad in search of the lost heir. They belonged to different apartments, and their personalities lay nowhere near on the spectrum; it was, however, weirdly, that she had gotten used to his presence, and had come to enjoy his company. 
	</p>
	<p>Speaking of which, Fae could hear someone approaching from behind, the footsteps of which she recognized.
	</p>
	<p>And sure enough, a chestnut haired young man plopped himself down beside her, and flung his legs over the edge of the platform. 
	</p>
	<p>Fae Baykartte shifted slightly as the man’s shoulders bumped lightly into hers. 
	</p>
	<p>“Fae,” he greeted, grinning.
	</p>
	<p>“Hi,” she said, giving a slight tilt of her chin.
	</p>
	<p>“Care if I join?” he asked in his velvety voice, tilting his head at her.
	</p>
	<p>“Well,” Fae said, amused, as she raised one brow, “you already welcomed yourself, didn’t you?”
	</p>
	<p>Esen Ventus flashed her a radiant smile, unfazed. “You can always say ‘no.’ I wouldn’t mind.”
	</p>
	<p>“In that case,” Fae gave him a nudge, “no.”
	</p>
	<p>“Okay,” Esen hummed in a sing-song type of tone, without the slightest intention to leave. Fae rolled her eyes, but smiled to herself.
	</p>
	<p>They sat in silence for quite some time, taking in the spectacle scenery that only they know of. And Fae thought about the recent events that seemed to have taken up most of their time respectively.
	</p>
	<p>“Why did you agree on Aestas Hyacinth’s proposal in the first place?” she asked, finally.
	</p>
	<p>“You know I refused at first.” 
	</p>
	<p>“And <i>you</i> know what I am asking about.”
	</p>
	<p>“Let’s just put it this way,” Esen said, lips lifting up into his signature smile. “There is as much to gain as there might be to lose. And you know that I am ambitious.”
	</p>
	<p>“Don’t tell me you’re really after the position for general.”
	</p>
	<p>Esen merely grinned, glancing away.
	</p>
	<p>“Hell,” Fae exclaimed softly, “you really are something.”
	</p>
	<p>“That goes without saying.”
	</p>
	<p>She chuckled. “I’m glad to see that you never change, Ventus.”
	</p>
	<p>“The same goes to you, Baykartte.”
	</p>
	<p>The world was bathed in a layer of cool purplish pink beneath their feet. Fae leaned back and stretched her legs far out, imagining what it would be like to dip her toes into the colors of the sunset. Next to her, instead of warning her the risks of falling off the edge, Esen mimicked her movements. He chuckled at the difference in length of their legs and nudged her shoulder playfully.
	</p>
	<p>“Is it all worth it though?” she said after a while, retreating her right leg back onto the platform and rested her chin on the knee. 
	</p>
	<p>“Is the position worth the risk of losing everything?” she asked, gazing at the windrider next to her.
	</p>
	<p>Esen mirrored her posture and gazed back at her, the black eyes sparkling against the golden light.
	</p>
	<p>“The future is worth everything,” he answered, grinning.
	</p>
	<p>“Not that it’s my business or anything,” Fae murmured, “but— you <i>do</i> know that you’re betting your career on the <i>tiniest</i> possibility that the first heir’s still alive, don’t you?”
	</p>
	<p>“Now that you mentioned it. Yes, it does seem like it,” he drawled. “Why? do you consider it to be too much of a gamble?” 
	</p>
	<p>A fleeting look of uncertainty flashed through his eyes, however, as he waited for her answer. 
	</p>
	<p>“No,” she sighed, after a second or two. She spoke contrary to what she truly thought.
	</p>
	<p><i>It is an unreasonable amount of faith. </i>
	</p>
	<p>But she knew deep down that her answer wouldn’t matter in the end. Ventus would never stop until he got to where he wanted to be. And she would rather be on his side than to drag down his spirits.
	</p>
	<p>Besides, on another note, what <i>was</i> a life without a little venture? 
	</p>
	<p>“There would always be risks we have to take along the way to the top,” she said with all seriousness, gazing back at the city down below, “this particular one is just larger than all that we encountered before.”
	</p>
	<p>“We?”
	</p>
	<p>Esen was grinning with satisfaction when he tilted his head at Fae. 
	</p>
	<p>She gave him a sidelong glance with an eyebrow raised. “I <i>am</i> your partner in crime, you know.”
	</p>
	<p>“In that case,” Esen laughed as he sprung up, flinging out his arms.
	</p>
	<p>Fae couldn’t help but break a small smile as she gazed up to see what he was up to.
	</p>
	<p>As the highwind swept up the tower and plunged at them from beneath, the vanilla white of his shirt flapped wildly against his sturdy body, while the chestnut brown of his hair swayed gently on the top of his head. Esen Ventus stood there, arm wide open, as if he were a giant bird, soaring in the glory of the burning sunset.
	</p>
	<p>“In that case,” he said, his smile dazzling. “Raise the bets, I’m all in.”
	</p>
	<p class="p"><i>“Gambler—”</i>
	</p>
	<p>Just as Fae Baykartte said that evening atop the wind tower, a few more times in the hidden war rooms and in their offices, Esen Ventus was known to take daring risks.
	</p>
	<p>This trait of Esen could be seen in both his strategies on paper <i>and</i> his performance in air. His confidence that he could accomplish anything beyond his limits if he tried— was the propeller for his constant advancement. 
	</p>
	<p>Esen Ventus <i>strived</i> to reach until he could not, to fly until his wings broke.
	</p>
	<p>Fae, on the other hand, was quite the opposite, although she <i>did</i> prefer to take large leaps, she would first make sure that the length to the other side of the gap was close enough for her to reach. If the challenge was within her abilities, she would raise the goal, but if she knew it was past her limits, she would take a step back and wait.
	</p>
	<p>Perhaps the similarities of their ambition and the differences of their approach, were the reasons Esen Ventus handed a part of his trust to Fae Baykartte, for he knew that she not only understood, but could also act as his safekeeper to prevent him from falling to his death.
	</p>
	<p>Regarding the recent events, both Fae and Ventus had no clue of the altitude of the mountain they were about to tackle, nor could they measure the lengths of the unknown cliffs along the way, but the golden rules they agreed upon without saying, was:  
	</p>
	<p class="p">One, never leap without looking.
	</p>
	<p>Two, never put all the eggs into the same basket.
	</p>
	<p>Three, never give up until reaching the top.
	</p>
	<p>And four, never look back even if one of them falls.
	</p>
	<p class="p">Words of cliché, yet hard to remember at all times and often overlooked.
	</p>
	<p class="p">During the secret meetings in Esen Ventus’ office, or rather, during Aestas Hyacinth’s unannounced visits which Esen had no choice but to let her in, the sixteen year old had eventually persuaded the young lieutenant of how valuable the results her proposal could be to his career. 
	</p>
	<p>Esen Ventus had found her reasonings of the matter to be quite compelling. Either the operation reached its final goal or not, there would always be something to gain.
	</p>
	<p>Ideally, it would be best if Aestas’ wish came true, and they found her sister.
	</p>
	<p>Candentia Hyacinth had also been his ally from long ago. As far as he heard, she had put in a good word for both Esen and Fae when their names were discussed in evaluations for appointing new lieutenants. If she were still alive, and were to be found, surely she would be grateful? Not to mention the high praise he and Fae could obtain from the king and the Land.
	</p>
	<p>Even if the results of the search didn’t turn out to be the most ideal, there is still the trust of the second heir, gained from the extents of the loyalty he displayed and the time he contributed. If Aestas Hyacinth were to become the only heir left of the Hyacinth throne, it would be wiser to be on her side when it happens.
	</p>
	<p>With that said, apart from finding the first heir being their short term goal, the second heir was the long term investment.
	</p>
	<p>On that account, both Fae and Esen took extra caution regarding Aestas’ opinion on every matter, while taking heed of her well being. They not only gave extra tips on how to improve her combat skills, but also participated in giving her a hand in sneaking out of the citadel to let off steam. The more Aestas was in good condition, the better it would be.
	</p>
	<p>It didn’t go unnoticed, though, that further into the next season, when the leaves of Annyo started turning colors and falling again, the Hyacinth heir seemed to be more in distress than ever.
	</p>
	<p>It was as Fae Baykartte described— “as if the glitter in the girl ran out of supply.”
	</p>
	<p>“Whatever is on your mind, dear princess?” Esen Ventus would ask in his velvety voice.
	</p>
	<p>“Any troubles?” Fae Baykartte would say, with her grayish pink eyes trained on the seventeen year old for an answer.
	</p>
	<p>“Just thinking about life,” Aestas would reply, “but I’m alright.”
	</p>
	<p>But the truth is, none of them thought it to be true. Despite that, the lieutenants didn’t press her about it, nor did the crystal weaver. 
	</p>
	<p>It was not until late autumn did Aestas turn to them for advice, having reached her limits. It was by then, did they confirm their respective speculations of the possible engagement of the Hyacinth heir and the Syarchia prince.
	</p>
	<p class="p">“They did dance the first dance together at the girl’s seventeenth birthday,” Fae had said, shrugging, when she and Esen discussed the matter over lightly. “And with the recent circumstances, the new political alliance is inevitable, if one thinks about it.”
	</p>
	<p>“Poor things,” Esen had sighed with sympathy. “I could never.”
	</p>
	<p>“Good thing there’s no one to tie up <i>your</i> wings,” Fae said to him.
	</p>
	<p>Esen had held both of his arms out, putting them together in front of himself, both fists facing upwards as if preparing to be taken into custody.
	</p>
	<p>“You could,” he said, jokingly, “I wouldn’t mind.”
	</p>
	<p class="p">It was late in the afternoon when Aestas pushed the door of her parent’s room open. She dreaded what lay before her.
	</p>
	<p>With her older sister gone, she often had a firsthand view of the turmoil that wracked the relationship of her parents. It was not until then did she realize the severity of their conflicts. Candentia must’ve done all she could to shield her from the traumatizing events. 
	</p>
	<p>Sharp pieces of broken vases scattered the floor as she stepped cautiously into the room. Her breath hitched with fear when another crash sounded, followed by the screams and shouts of both her parents.
	</p>
	<p><b><i>“You are nothing but a liar! A coward!” </i></b>Queen Merythdian screamed at the top of her lungs. Her voice was sore, and tears were streaming down her face. 
	</p>
	<p><b><i>“I am being suffocated!”</i></b> King Estive roared, <b><i>“what do you want me to do? Kill myself?”</i></b> It was he who threw the vase at the wall.
	</p>
	<p>Aestas couldn’t bring herself to step further into the room, and slipped away again. She ran down the halls to her own office and closed the door behind her. 
	</p>
	<p>With her back against the cool wooden material, she took some deep breaths to calm herself down. Her heart thumped loudly against her ears, the shouts echoing in her mind.
	</p>
	<p>She <i>was</i> planning to talk to the king and queen about her thoughts on the possible political engagement of her and the Syarchian prince. It wasn’t that they did not discuss it before, but rather that she had some new insights of how she preferred what her own life to be, and had the desire to share it with them.
	</p>
	<p>Aestas slid down on the floor of her empty office, and thought about the last time she had the conversation with her parents. 
	</p>
	<p class="p">“I don’t want to,” she simply told them, which their eyes had widened with surprise.
	</p>
	<p>“Why? Little one,” her father asked, “is the Aouthyerhl boy mean to you?”
	</p>
	<p>“No,” Aestas had replied, “he is nothing but gentle and kind.”
	</p>
	<p>“And good looking, too,” her mother chimed in.
	</p>
	<p>Aestas giggled, agreeing. “Yes,” she said, “but that’s not what I am concerned about.”
	</p>
	<p>“Then tell us, little one,” her father said, brows furrowed.
	</p>
	<p><i>“I don’t want to,”</i> Aestas emphasized, “because that means that it would be <i>you</i>, sealing my fate for <i>me</i>. Not to mention that it is to insecure a political ally. And that— would be taking our happiness away.”
	</p>
	<p>“But you two get along with each other so beautifully,” Merythdian said.
	</p>
	<p><b>“Of course we get along!”</b> Aestas nearly cried out, “we have been living at the Nix together with Candentia ever since we were little kids!”
	</p>
	<p>“When I saw you two doing the first dance together at your seventeenth birthday ball,” the kind pondered, “I thought it could be what you wanted.”
	</p>
	<p><i>“It’s not.”</i>
	</p>
	<p>“I understand that now. But…”
	</p>
	<p>Her parents seemed torn. 
	</p>
	<p>Aestas could see that her mother had truly misunderstood her close relationship with Tsahn Aouthyerhl. As for her father, to her surprise, Aestas could tell that he seemed to be backing down on the thought, after she stated her reluctance to them.
	</p>
	<p>Her heart softened. And she felt a sense of sudden guilt bubbling up in her stomach. She didn’t want to let either one of them down, despite the situation.
	</p>
	<p>“Don’t you think,” she had started again carefully, “that it might be best not to rush it?”
	</p>
	<p>Both of her parents’ faces lit up at the sentence. 
	</p>
	<p>“So you <i>do</i> like the idea?”
	</p>
	<p>She squirmed, and swallowed down the “no,” and said instead, “I will have to think about it carefully. I need some more time.”
	</p>
	<p>“Take as much time as you need,” her father ruffled her hair, “the Syarchians would be willing to wait.”
	</p>
	<p>“You are such an angel,” her mother had cooed, while pulling her into an embrace, showering her with kisses. 
	</p>
	<p>“What would we do without you?”
	</p>
	<p class="p">The crashing of vases and her parent’s words replayed in her mind like a broken record, and Aestas groaned. Her head was throbbing.
	</p>
	<p>She then laughed out, as she sat there with her palms rubbing her face, trying to get rid of the irritation that was filling her heart. It seems like she would have to make up her mind and deliver her opinions some other time.
	</p>
	<p>“What would Candentia do?” She thought to herself. “What would she say?” 
	</p>
	<p>It was over a year since her sister disappeared, yet Aestas still held tight to her shadows and chased after her phantoms without even realizing. 
	</p>
	<p>As a distraction, she went on wondering what the lieutenants were up to these days. 
	</p>
	<p class="p">Apart from the secret search, both Lieutenant Baykartte and Lieutenant Ventus participated in the training of the officers. A new plan for combined units of the R.A. departments have been under practice for the past two seasons. 
	</p>
	<p>Under the current turbulence of Csettrecsran, small military squads such as the one general Solicas had led to the border of the North just after the abduction of the lost heir, were high on demand. Hence, the three generals had come together and created an operation to train their corps in combined teams.
	</p>
	<p>Rather than randomly patching up a temporary squad for during an emergency, it could be more efficient if some of the selected members of the R.A. trained together beforehand.
	</p>
	<p>Therefore, teams were formed, and captains were assigned. 
	</p>
	<p>Baykartte and Ventus, both being lieutenants, had become two of the team captains in the operations.
	</p>
	<p>Each team, an imitation of the exemplary squad aforementioned, consists of nine members— three officers from each department. 
	</p>
	<p>Brontes Laers and Ivian Lena had both been selected, and unfortunately, ended up on the same team. Both of the young officers had already been named officials, and now were corporals. They displayed perfect professionalism when it came to business, but still, never changing, fought whenever they could as soon as they stepped out of their superiors’ sight.
	</p>
	<p class="p">Brontes Laers was minding his own business when he heard the infuriating voice of Esen Ventus. He ducked behind a fellow swordsman immediately and waddled to hide behind a weapon stand.
	</p>
	<p>After his enlistment in the royal army, he had tried to steer clear of the said lieutenant. It should’ve been easy, for they belonged in different departments. But as it turned out, Ventus happened to come by the centers from time to time, along with other lieutenants, to watch over their combined combat training. 
	</p>
	<p>Sometimes, during the recess in between the drills, Ventus would stroll over to their unit with a radiant grin on his face. Although he was a public enemy of the R.S.W., he seemed to be on friendly terms with Lieutenant Baykartte, Brontes’ direct superior.  
	</p>
	<p>Although having to team up with his nemesis, Lena, was a reality  tough for Brontes to swallow, it was to his relief, however, that they did not end up in Ventus’ squad.
	</p>
	<p class="p">“Hiding from someone?” a sly whisper came from behind.
	</p>
	<p>“You, again,” Brontes rolled his eyes as he turned to face Ivian Lena. She had squatted down beside him, and peered out the way he was.
	</p>
	<p>“We are on the same team now,” she gave him a look of distaste. “It looks like we will be spending a lot of time together, even if we don’t want to.”
	</p>
	<p>He grumbled that he felt the same.
	</p>
	<p>As she hopped up beside him, also hiding from Ventus, Brontes took the chance and studied her face. The previous roundness in her cheeks had gone away, and her chin was sharper. The piercing amber eyes that glinted with rusty orange still remained the same, if not sharper than ever, when she locked eyes with him. He noticed that something about her was different, and tilted his head, scanning her over.
	</p>
	<p>“What?” she asked, as she hastily brushed a loose strand of silky black behind her ear with unease, suddenly feeling self conscious.
	</p>
	<p><i>It’s her hair—</i> Brontes eyes lit up with realization, having finally solved the mystery.
	</p>
	<p>Ivian’s silky black hair had been cut short, which the hairstyle quite suited her, in his opinion, although he would never admit out loud.
	</p>
	<p>“Again…what?” she deadpanned, staring back at him 
	</p>
	<p>“Nothing,” he replied, “what do you think about it?”
	</p>
	<p>“Of what?”
	</p>
	<p>“Of us being on the same squad. Why do you think they teamed us together?”
	</p>
	<p>“I suppose it’s because that our last names both starts with a ‘L?’”
	</p>
	<p>No, that was not the reason, and they both knew it. It was a result of the meetings the team captains had beforehand, where they named their preferred team members, and negotiated which result could be the best. It was said that Fae Baykartte might have saved both Laers and Lena from Ventus’ clutches.
	</p>
	<p>Brontes raised his eyebrows and tossed her another question, “what do <i>you</i> think of us being on the same team?”
	</p>
	<p>Ivian hid her facial expressions from the other as she stood back up. “Such bad luck. It’s unfortunate. And I despise it,” she shot at him, “is that enough?”
	</p>
	<p>“Well, I guessed so,” Brontes replied coldly, biting down on his tongue. Annoyance filled up his heart when he realized that he was slightly hurt by her sharp words.
	</p>
	<p>“What about you?” Ivian asked, despite herself.
	</p>
	<p>“The same as you, <i>little dragon,”</i> he hissed without a second thought. If she wanted them to be enemies, then enemies it is.
	</p>
	<p>Upon the nickname, Ivian’s face grew hot, which Brontes interpreted as anger, for “Laers’ little pet dragon” was what Ventus liked to call her.
	</p>
	<p>“Little ‘Stormy,’” Ivian snarled back.
	</p>
	<p>“Little tiger,” Brontes smirked.
	</p>
	<p>He turned away with triumph when his opponent sputtered, unable to return the attack. She was the one with more nicknames from their superiors after all.
	</p>
	<p>“Lieutenant,” he saluted as Fae Baykartte, their team captain strolled over.
	</p>
	<p>“Back to work,” Baykartted commanded, snapping her fingers. 
	</p>
	<p>And she smirked, the same way Brontes Laers did just now as she turned to Ivian Lena. 
	</p>
	<p>The young corporal looked as if all energy was already drained out of her. She glared at Brontes, who was gloating over her misfortune on the side.
	</p>
	<p class="pend"> “What are you waiting for, <i>little tiger?</i>” Fae Baykartted said, an eyebrow raised as she smiled, “there’s no time to waste. We are in the eye of the storm.” 
	</p>
