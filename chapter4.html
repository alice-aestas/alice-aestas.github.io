	<h2 class="chapter title">The Summer Festival</h2>

<div class="chaptercontent">
	<p><b class="b">C</b>louds started to gather over Annyo at midnight. And early in the morning, Tsahn Aouthyerhl woke up to the sound of pouring rain. He rolled on his back and stared at the ceiling for a while, thinking about how Candentia might go crazy if the preparations were stalled by the summer storm; and how miserable Aestas would be, to be stuck indoors. But contrary to his predictions, when he went down to the ground floor of the Nix, he saw in surprise that the two sisters were chatting away merrily, already mid-way through breakfast. 
	</p>
	<p>Candentia Hyacinth seemed to be in a good mood. In fact, she was beaming in a way that made Tsahn question himself of whether he had dreamt up the big fight between the sisters yesterday. Tsahn looked the first heir up and down— the girl was sitting sideways with her legs crossed. She had on a flowy white shirt, tucked into high-waisted black shorts, and Tsahn could see that she had on her garters with two daggers hanging on each side of her right thigh— a typical casual look of the first heir. 
	</p>
	<p>“Oh, come eat your breakfast, and quit staring at me as if I got possessed by a ghost,” Candentia rolled her eyes at Tsahn playfully.
	</p>
	<p>“Are you?” he questioned in earnest, which earned him another eye roll.
