	<h2 class="chapter title">The Summer Festival</h2>

<div class="chaptercontent">
	<p><b class="b">C</b>louds started to gather over Annyo at midnight. And early in the morning, Tsahn Aouthyerhl woke up to the sound of pouring rain. He rolled on his back and stared at the ceiling for a while, thinking about how Candentia might go crazy if the preparations were stalled by the summer storm; and how miserable Aestas would be, to be stuck indoors. But contrary to his predictions, when he went down to the ground floor of the Nix, he saw in surprise that the two sisters were chatting away merrily, already mid-way through breakfast. 
	</p>
	<p>Candentia Hyacinth seemed to be in a good mood. In fact, she was beaming in a way that made Tsahn question himself of whether he had dreamt up the big fight between the sisters yesterday. Tsahn looked the first heir up and down— the girl was sitting sideways with her legs crossed. She had on a flowy white shirt, tucked into high-waisted black shorts, and Tsahn could see that she had on her garters with two daggers hanging on each side of her right thigh— a typical casual look of the first heir. 
	</p>
	<p>“Oh, come eat your breakfast, and quit staring at me as if I got possessed by a ghost,” Candentia rolled her eyes at Tsahn playfully.
	</p>
	<p>“Are you?” he questioned in earnest, which earned him another eye roll. 
	</p>
	<p>“We made up, if that’s what’s on your mind,” she said, as she pulled her little sister closer and ruffled the younger’s hair. “Isn’t that right?” she asked Aestas cheerfully.
	</p>
	<p>Aestas squealed and flung her arms around her sister, face scrunched up in delight. “Yay—!” she cheered, the lime-green eyes filled with laughter and relief, “of course—!”
	</p>
	<p>Tsahn reached out, also to ruffle Aestas’ hair, making her gradient brown locks and gold highlights even more entangled. 
	</p>
	<p>The fifteen-year old seemed not to mind her hair being messed up, for she beamed from ear to ear, rather enjoying the attention and pampering from the older two. She, too, had woken up to the sound of pouring rain, and had been dreading to go downstairs where she reckoned the air was going to be suffocating and freezing from her sister’s temper— she had decided that she would sneak out and bail again, if the atmosphere was too heavy to endure. But much to her astonishment, the older seemed to have made peace with her own mind and greeted Aestas with a rather friendly “good morning!” — to which Aestas responded with hesitation and confusion.
	</p>
	<p class="p">“I’m sorry, Candentia—” Aestas had said cautiously, after she sat down, “I’m sorry for yesterday.”
	</p>
	<p>“It’s fine,” Candentia had replied, her voice light, “it really is. I shouldn’t have put so much pressure on you.”
	</p>
	<p>Somehow the sudden change of the other made her feel a mixture of slight fear and relief— her stomach churned uncomfortably. Aestas shook her head and said in a small voice, “— and I’m sorry for wrecking the carvings on your door.”
	</p>
	<p>At this, Candentia chuckled softly. “Oh— that— it’s alright. And actually—” 
	</p>
	<p>She got up and went over, placing a hand on Aestas’ head— making the younger Hyacinth’s eyes well up with tears almost instantly.
	</p>
	<p> “I’m sorry to have lost my temper and shoved the door. I’ll try to avoid doing that in the future.” Candentia Hyacinth’s tone was earnest.
	</p>
	<p>The lime-green eyes couldn’t hold back their tears eventually. And after a long period of Aestas’ sobbing and Candentia’s calm comforting, the sisters finally settled on planning the preparations for the upcoming festival, racing the time before tending to their respective daily activities and responsibilities of the day.
	</p>
	<p class="p">“I see that you took my advice,” Tsahn said, slightly panting, before taking a sip of water. He was squatting beside the inner wall of one of the training rooms, in the first basement of the R.A. buildings, resting— a small break in between combat training sessions.
	</p>
	<p>Candentia Hyacinth, who stood with her back and one foot up against the wall, had just finished retying her ash black waves into a high ponytail. She lowered her foot and looked down over at the honey-brown head two steps beside her. 
	</p>
	<p>The two had their combined training sessions scheduled every morning before the rooms got occupied by the associate members of the R.A. — there were about fifty advanced trainees that made it to the list of potential official members of the R.A., and often had their training done in the first basement as well— Candentia and Tsahn had come across some of the possible new recruits from time to time.
	</p>
	<p>“I thought about what you said last night,” she said thoughtfully, “and although it was hard for me to understand at first… it made sense.”
	</p>
	<p>Tsahn hummed and said, “I didn’t expect you to adapt so quickly though.” He tilted his face up to look Candentia in the eye, still squatting with his arms resting on his knees. She smiled at him as she wiped the sweat off the side of her neck with the back of her hand— she was wearing a pair of black fingerless gloves at the moment.
	</p>
	<p>“Well,” she said, “I figured the situation was kinda urgent. It was starting to feel like attempting to tame a wild horse without a bridle.”
	</p>
	<p>At this, Tsahn let out a small wheeze, “she is somewhat like a wild horse,” he agreed, eyes smiling. “And I’m glad it worked out. I was actually worried that your efforts might be for nothing.”
	</p>
	<p>When Tsahn told Candentia how the younger heir was spiraling downhill and going through a hard time in her life, and that the best solution to possibly help her was to not push her away and create a safe place for her at the Nix, the older of the Hyacinth sisters had looked at him as if someone had just hit her hard with the back of a sword.
	</p>
	<p class="p">“She has become quite wild and rebellious these days,” Tsahn had said to Candentia Hyacinth with gentle honesty in the hall, after Aestas had stormed back to her room, “and I know you mean well— but I don’t think being so hard on her would get her to face her responsibilities.”
	</p>
	<p>Candentia nibbled her lower lip as she listened, a tight knot forming in her stomach. It was rare for Tsahn to speak his mind on any shorts of conflicts.
	</p>
	<p>“The thing is, I think you ought to act quick if you don’t want to lose your sister,” he said, thinking carefully. “I really don’t want to be the one to say this… but… I think you’ll have to swallow your dissatisfaction and endure whatever she throws at you, Cadenty—”
	</p>
	<p>He had waited for her to say something but all that sounded was silence. Candentia was stunned, to be honest. It never occurred to her that she would hear these words coming out of Tsahn’s mouth. Tsahn— whom she had known and lived with from the age of ten, her best friend, the person who always had her back, who had always coaxed her to express her suppressed emotions. Yet, it was through his soft voice that she heard the words— “conceal it, and no matter how angry you are— don’t let it show.”
	</p>
	<p>“And by ‘don’t let it show,’ you should try and avoid appearing cold and unresponsive,” he added bluntly, “try calm cheerfulness, if that makes sense.”
	</p>
	<p>But at the same time, because it was Tsahn who was talking, Candentia actually listened, and thought that there definitely had to be a reason why he dared give such drastic advice— so she took in whatever slipped gently past his lips with her full attention. And even though it did hurt her, after one restless night of deep thinking, Candentia Hyacinth decided to put Tsahn’s words into action. 
	</p>
	<p class="p">“Are you not feeling well?” Tsahn’s concerned voice dragged Candentia back to the training room they were in.
	</p>
	<p>He had risen up from the squatting position and was standing in front of Candentia, towering over her and peering into her eyes. She took the towel draped over her left shoulder, reached up, and flung it over his head.
	</p>
	<p>“Not the best,” she admitted as she ruffled his damp hair. 
	</p>
	<p>He whined with protest.
	</p>
	<p>“You?” Candentia asked Tsahn. He had held her hands still and peaked out from under his fluffy locks of honey brown hair. 
	</p>
	<p>“What—?” he asked as he pouted slightly.
	</p>
	<p>She laughed softly. Although his body has changed over the course of the years, and seemed to have grown much taller, his eyes still remained the same— clear yellow hazel and full of gentle innocence.
	</p>
	<p>“Are you feeling alright?” she asked in her same soft voice, gently draping the towel around his neck, “it looks like you haven’t had a good night’s sleep,” she pulled him slightly closer and said with a playful tone— “you’re blinking slow and your moments aren’t as agile.” 
	</p>
	<p>“Are you calling me slow?” he grinned, “looks like I have to up my game— let’s see who wins then.” 
	</p>
	<p>The truth was, Tsahn Aouthyerhl didn’t sleep much the night before— he was, too, thinking of the conversation he had with Candentia in the hallway outside of their bedrooms, and he wondered if  he shouldn’t have said what he said. Candentia was his lifesaver, and she and Aurelius had been all he knew for a long time since his arrival at the citadel, when he was just a little child, and he had sworn to himself that he would never do anything that might hurt either one of them, and had kept that promise since he could ever remember. He never imagined that there would be a day where he would be the one to tell Candentia to “—endure whatever she throws at you.” 
	</p>
	<p>He grit his teeth and cursed at himself. Tsahn knew that Candentia would never blame him in any kind of way, but her stunned face kept on reappearing in his mind, and her dark gray eyes which were full of confusion and disbelief, stared at him whenever he closed his own eyes.
	</p>
	<p>“Aouthyerhl!” a sharp voice cut through the air and cleared his mind— it was the second lieutenant of the R.S.D.
	</p>
	<p>“If you’re not going to concentrate, you might as well leave before you get yourself hurt,” Lieutenant Baykartte said, her voice stern. 
	</p>
	<p>Tsahn snapped back to his senses and adjusted his posture, face flustered. Candentia glanced at him, worried. Fae Baykartte simply tilted her head and squinted at her students, inspecting their movements as the training went on. It appeared to her that both of the young ones seemed rather distracted.
	</p>
	<p>“So— how are they doing?” an unfamiliar voice of a male sounded from behind. Fae Baykartte stepped aside and turned around, and was met with a young man with chestnut colored hair. He had a rather smart-looking face with a thin nose and dark eyebrows, and from the flying-goggles that hung backwards behind his neck, Fae could recognize that this was supposedly one of the windriders of the R.A.
	</p>
	<p>The young man smiled—  his midnight-black eyes oozing with confidence, “I reckon that you should be Lieutenant Baykartte?” he said, and murmured jokingly, “although you really do look a bit young for the job.” 
	</p>
	<p>Fae Baykartte gave him a tiny glare, she was tired of the comment— people that didn’t recognize her had often mistook her as a primary trainee even when she was in her second lieutenant uniform. 
	</p>
	<p>“I’m Fae Baykartte,” she said coldly, holding out her hand, “and you are—?”
	</p>
	<p>“Esen—” the brunette said, “my name is Esen Ventus.” He gave her hand a firm shake and smiled slightly when he realized that both of their hands were cold despite the summer. Both were born of winter, it seemed.
	</p>
	<p>Ah, so this was the Esen of the R.W.D. that people were talking about— pride of the wind-riders, a headache to the R.S.D., and one of the gifted that finished the whole course of R.A. training within four years. He had only turned twenty five two seasons ago (half an year) — one year younger than she was. If he were to be made second lieutenant this year, he would break her record of being the youngest to ever reach the position.
	</p>
	<p>“Sergeant Ventus,” she acknowledged, retracting her hand, “what brings you here?”
	</p>
	<p>“Lieutenant Nyek sent me,” he replied. Ges Nyek is a thirty two year old, stout looking man with reddish brown hair and dark orange eyes, and is one of the second lieutenants of the R.W.D., making him one of Esen Ventus’ direct superiors.
	</p>
	<p>The first lieutenants of the three R.A. departments are in charge of managing the associate members that are in their final year of training, and the second lieutenants are to train the members personally. It happened that three of the second lieutenants, each from every department, have another responsibility of teaching combat lessons to the Hyacinths heirs and the diplomatic hostage— Tsahn Aouthyerhl. Being underage, Aestas Hyacinth normally had her training done with peers her same age at the academy on the main castle grounds and at the educational district of Annyo, and only took occasional lessons at the R.A. departments from time to time.
	</p>
	<p> The primary academy, situated on the far south of the square at the back of main castle grounds, is where spring and autumn lessons of primary skills in combat and enchantment are taught to the children of Annyo, ages ranging from six to twelve, while the middle and advanced CES academies (Combat and Enchantment seasonal academies) were situated amongst the other schools in the educational district of Annyo city— Kanterra, northwest of the citadel. 
	</p>
	<p>While Aestas rarely joined the R.A. departments for training and preferred being outside of the citadel, Candentia Hyacinth and Tsahn Aouthyerhl had been under quite an opposite style of schedule, and have been training with the departments ever since they lived at the Nix, and only joined the academies when tournaments were held. Therefore, they were quite familiar with the officials of the R.A., especially the second lieutenants that trained them.
	</p>
	<p class="p">If Ges Nyek sent Esen Ventus, then it could only mean that either Nyek was somewhere buried in public duties for the preparation of the upcoming festival, or— that sergeant Ventus is to be taking over Nyek’s job at training Candentia Hyacinth and Tsahn Aouthyerhl. 
	</p>
	<p class="p">“Hyacinth! Aouthyerhl!” Fae barked, “halt.”
	</p>
	<p>The duo stopped, looked over, and noticed the tall brunette standing behind their ivory-haired trainer— both of them recognized him at once.
	</p>
	<p>“Esen—” Candentia started, but changed her tone quickly— “sergeant Ventus.”
	</p>
	<p>“What are you doing here? Esen—” Tsahn greeted, and hastily changed his words as well, “sergeant Ventus.”
	</p>
	<p>Fae Baykartte looked slightly surprised, she didn’t expect the young sergeant to be on a first name basis with the two.
	</p>
	<p>“I’m one of the fleet captains,” he explained to Lieutenant Baykartte, “they come by my wing from time to time, and I taught them a thing or two over the summers.”
	</p>
	<p>Sure enough— the young sergeant is a team captain on the wind-riders’  wave-fleet, which is a crew of wind-riders that not only ride the wind on windboards, but also with small sailboats.
	</p>
	<p>Tsahn and Candentia exchanged glances— if Esen Ventus was to become one of their trainers, it could only mean one thing. Could it be? They communicated in silence with each other. Well, we will see—
	</p>
	<p class="p">It was the second day of the summer festival, and also the birthday of the second heir of Hyacinth. The continuous rain had ceased a few days ago, and the sky was of a clear blue once again with fluffs of pure white clouds floating peacefully. Brontes Lares had opened his eyes with a start early that dawn, feeling all jittery inside— it was the day that he would finally become an official member of the R.A.
	</p>
	<p>And now that he was standing on stage, along with the other associate members that completed the ultimate training program, he felt like the loud cheering exploding beneath was going to blow him away. Brontes Laers squinted his eyes— he could see the back of the main castle’s east wing, far away on the other side of the square in front of him. The large square between the citadel garden grounds and the main castle building was flooded with people in festive attires, and although there was one young looking lad that had on only a simple outfit, the colorful and exaggerated clothes made it seem like an ocean of flowers in bloom. Trumpets blasted out, signaling the start of the R.A. ceremony— where the anticipated list of new recruits of the royal army would finally be announced. The Citadel rumbled with excitement. 
	</p>
	<p>It felt surreal— as Brontes Laers knelt down, his heart pounded against the newly pinned badge in front of his chest, the beating deafening to his ears. The sound of the crowd was downed out for a split second as a long black cloak with blue linings was flung open gracefully above his head. It floated— and as it landed behind his back and draped around his broad shoulders, he could hear the boiling of the square once again.
	</p>
	<p>“Brontes Laers— ” the second heir of Hyacinth said from above, her voice clear and bright, “you are now an official member of the Royal Swordsmen Department— servant to the Royal Army. You may now rise.”
	</p>
	<p>He adjusted the cloak slightly after he stood back up, still not used to the weight of the fabric. 
	</p>
	<p>“Congratulations, officer Laers,” the young princess said as she reached out her hand. This was the first time Brontes Laers had ever stood face to face with the second heir of his homeland— the sixteen year old had on a creamy colored gown draped with lime-green laces that matched the exact color of her eyes, and the soft sheer sleeves draped loosely around her shoulders. Half of her gradient brown hair was braided up, and the lower layers of soft brown and golden highlights swayed behind her neck, the length just long enough to brush her shoulders. There was a light brown beauty spot on her right cheek, and the lower eyelashes of her hooded eyes were long and curly. And even though she did look a bit nervous, the heart-shaped lips of the young girl were tugged into a bright smile at the moment.
	</p>
	<p>“I am ever so grateful,” Brontes Laers slipped his hand under the small gloved hand and gave it a gentle lift, and said with a confident smile— “and happy birthday to you, dear princess.”
	</p>
	<p>Aestas Hyacinth, upon hearing his tone and witnessing the smile, laughed— a bright, crisp sound that resembled the energetic chirp of morning birds. 
	</p>
	<p>“Thank you,” the second heir of Hyacinth giggled, her long lower lashes trembling as she did, “and we all thank you in advance for your service.”
	</p>
	<p>She casted down her eyes, feeling a bit shy under the confident gaze— the newly appointed young officer somehow reminded her of another young and talented member of the R.A., and she wondered how they would react if the two ever got a chance to meet with each other— she hoped that they would become good friends.
	</p>
	<p class="p">“Lena,” someone called Ivian Lena from behind. It was Brontes Laers. He had just entered the enormous ballroom and spotted his nemesis roaming near the flowers on one side. Ivian actually had caught sight of Brontes Laers as soon as he walked into the room, but had pretended not to notice. She bit slightly on her lip and forged an expression of indifference.
	</p>
	<p>“Laers,” she greeted.
	</p>
	<p>While the newly appointed officials were being announced in the meantime, the new official members of the R.A. had been led to the main hall of the main castle after receiving their new badges and stepping off of the stage— in advance before the official start of the birthday ball for their second heir. 
	</p>
	<p>“Why come to me? Don’t you have any other people you can talk to?” Ivian Lena crossed her arms and smiled at the other with slanting eyes. 
	</p>
	<p>“You seemed so lonely, standing by yourself,” Laers returned her taunting smile, “and I felt sorry for you. Don’t you have anyone you can chat with?”
	</p>
	<p>Ivian Lena clicked her tongue and pushed Brontes on the shoulder with one hand, out of her way, as she stalked past him without saying a word, her silky black ponytail swayed behind her with every step. Ivian felt Brontes Laers’ burning gaze follow her as she tried to walk calmly through swarms of people in colorful outfits that were beginning to fill up the room. However, when she turned slightly and glanced back from the corner of her eye, Brontes Laers had already swirled to another corner where two other girls in beautiful dresses were standing. He seems to have whispered something sweet when he leaned down near their ears, for the girls blushed and giggled shyly. 
	</p>
	<p>Such Laers behavior.
	</p>
	<p>Laers must’ve felt Lena’s gaze for he glanced up suddenly, still bending down slightly as he met her eyes with a smirk. His ash black hair had been combed up, same as the other R.A. members for the special occasion, leaving his forehead almost bare, where a strand of loose hair fell across and in between his bushy eyebrows. His long olive green eyes locked with her rusty brick-colored ones for a moment, the taunting glint still visible. Ivian growled quietly and jerked her eyes away, and this time, she disappeared into the other ballroom without looking back again. 
	</p>
	<p class="p">After Lena had left the room, instead of feeling the high from victory, Brontes was slightly bored, and had roamed around the ballrooms, striking up conversations with random people. He drummed his fingers on his thigh and sighed— his family would arrive only after the end of the R.A. announcement ceremony, which they persisted in watching every year. 
	</p>
	<p>Brontes’ olive green eyes lit up when he spotted a familiar face.
	</p>
	<p>“Trina,” he called out. 
	</p>
	<p>The twenty three year old blonde was in a lilac-colored evening gown; draped behind her back, was a black cloak with the upper half covered in purple. She stood in a small circle of people that wore similar outfits, though the types of the cloaks were different from one another. Trina Krelnein murmured something to her company and bowed slightly before backing out of the group. She waved a gloved hand as she came towards Brontes. 
	</p>
	<p>“Hey there,” Trina greeted him brightly, “I see now you know what the badges were for.” She pointed at his chest— her piece of work glistened boldly against his midnight-blue silky uniform.
	</p>
	<p>Brontes Laers smiled, his teeth showing slightly, and said “well, you sure were secretive about it.”
	</p>
	<p>Trina Krelnein laughed— a sound of soft bells chiming against the gentle breeze.
	</p>
	<p>“I was never supposed to tell anyone about it.”
	</p>
	<p>“But Lena knew.”
	</p>
	<p>“Well, she is my childhood friend, and I can’t hide any secrets from her. It’s not like I told her directly myself,” she explained, slightly sticking out her tongue as she laughed softly, “Ivian just guessed it by looking at my reactions— I was too overjoyed when I realized that she was going to make it into the team.”
	</p>
	<p>“And there’s also you being a member of the R.A.,” Brontes Laers gestured to her cloak. The purple color indicates that she belongs to the Royal Enchanters Department, while the half black, half purple pattern means that she was more than just a normal member.
	</p>
	<p>“Corporal?” he asked, just to be certain.
	</p>
	<p>Trina Krelnein smiled sheepishly. “Yup, that’s me,” she replied. Her soft baby blue eyes darted at his gaze.
	</p>
	<p>“Damn, that’s impressive,” Brontes said with respect. “You are the same age as I am, but already an official member with rank.”
	</p>
	<p>He stopped for a second, “wait,” he realized— “that doesn’t make sense— Lena and I were already trained with the shortest amount of time for the requirements of the R.A. How’s it possible for you to…? When did you join the R.A.?”
	</p>
	<p>Trina Krelnein smiled an uneasy smile and opened up her mouth to answer. A black shadow spread suddenly in front of her eyes, shielding her from Brontes Laers’ intent gaze.
	</p>
	<p>“Stop with the interrogation already,” her childhood friend’s voice sounded coldly.
	</p>
	<p>Ivian Lena had reached out an arm and blocked in between the two with her own black cloak. She glanced at Trina with concern as the small blonde grabbed her arm gently and peeked over.
	</p>
	<p>“It’s alright, Ivian,” Trina comforted, “it’s not a secret of what he’s asking, and I was going to be introduced to the new members anyways.”
	</p>
	<p>Ivian Lena lowered her arm, and Trina smiled cutely, glancing from Lena to Laers— the young officers refused to look at one another.
	</p>
	<p>“Stay, will you?” Trina Krelnein asked, tugging gently on Ivian’s sleeve, “I’m sure Brontes here wouldn’t mind, would you?” her soft baby blue eyes glanced up into his olive green ones. The corner of his lips tugged slightly and he shrugged.
	</p>
	<p>“Ivian!” someone called from the crowd. The trio looked up. It was Ivian’s family— they waved and beckoned for her, overjoyed to finally see the girl after such a long time. They seemed extremely proud to see her in the midnight-blue shirt, ivory-white pants and the long black cloak with blue linings. 
	</p>
	<p>Ivian Lena waved, telling them she would be right over before placing a hand on top of the small blonde and bending down next to her ear, “I’ll let you two talk. Come find me after you guys are done. And if this prick here is giving you a hard time,” she glared up at Brontes Laers, who averted his eyes, dodging her burning gaze, “don’t hesitate to slap him, or else I will.”
	</p>
	<p>“You two really don’t get along, do you?” Trina Krelnein mused, after being left alone with Brontes.
	</p>
	<p> The young officer shrugged again and smiled resignedly, his bushy eyebrows slightly tugged inwards.
	</p>
	<p>“So you were saying?” He changed back to the previous subject, “you don’t have to answer if you’re not comfortable to,” he added hastily, “but I’m curious— how long have you been in the R.A.?
	</p>
	<p>“Ah—” Trina counted her fingers, “about five years already. I joined the official team when I was eighteen, and had my training after,” she played with her soft blonde curls and laughed softly, “I’m a crystal weaver, you see?”
	</p>
	<p>It seemed like he guessed correctly about her abilities back when they were in the shop, when he and Lena witnessed how the small blonde weaved spells with a small transparent needle— which was now confirmed to be made of Southern Crystal— a material so hard to control when casting enchantments that whoever happened to have the rare ability to do so, were recruited into the R.A. as soon as they come of age, without the need of undergoing any tests.
	</p>
	<p>“But what about Krelnein’s badges? How come you can open up a shop down at the alleys in Pagiet Lane when you have duties in the Citadel? That’s allowed?” Bronted couldn’t help but shower the other with questions.
	</p>
	<p>Trina, who was used to these inquiries, answered patiently— “well, we crystal weavers are so rare that they made an exception,” she looked at Brontes with one eye open, “you could call it ‘special treatment’ if you want,” she laughed softly.
	</p>
	<p>“And besides,” she added, “I still work under the royal family even outside the R.A. To be honest, there’s not that much of a difference from an official supplier to a R.A. member.”
	</p>
	<p>Brontes nodded slowly as he took in the information.
	</p>
	<p>“So— you as an official supplier, are in charge of all the badges of the Citadel?” he continued to ask.
	</p>
	<p>“Yup, so I’ve been heeella busy these days, making all the new badges for you guys,” she stuck her tiny tongue out at him playfully, “but to tell you the truth,” she continued, “I’d rather do this than anything else— the pay is good, and there’s the bonus benefit of getting to know who’s gonna make the list and who’s getting promoted even before the announcement ceremony.”
	</p>
	<p>“How does that work?” he asked, and pulled her closer to save her from being stomped over by a group of teenagers passing— the ballrooms started to fill up with colorful people. 
	</p>
	<p>“Well, you see,” she blushed as his scent of fresh pine trees consumed her, “it’s actually really simple—” she steadied herself, “you handed me a piece of paper that day, right? The one your superiors instructed you to give me?”
	</p>
	<p>Brontes nodded— “What about it?”
	</p>
	<p>“Everyone that is to receive a new badge comes to me with a paper like that,” she stepped back a little, out of his grasp, “and there’s a code which only I can decipher— it tells me what type of badge I’m supposed to make. And as every official order of the list is delivered to me in person, I get to see all of your faces and read what position you are to become.”
	</p>
	<p>“In person?” Brontes furrowed his eyebrows, suddenly remembering something, “so there’s no chance for the order to be delivered by an errand boy?”
	</p>
	<p>“What errand boy? What are you talking about?” she looked confused, “as I said— if you were to come by my shop with an official order for a new badge, it means that you are to make the official team.”
	</p>
	<p>Brontes’ olive green eyes clouded with unease— he had a bad feeling.
	</p>
	<p>“So that windrider that day at your shop— he isn’t an errand boy after all?”
	</p>
	<p>“What windrider?”
	</p>
	<p>“That Esan guy. So he made the official team?” Even as he asked, he still thought that it was unlikely, for he never once saw the irritating brunette at the combined training centers with the other associate members. And when the list of new wind-riders were announced, he had listened intently and swore that he never heard the name Esan.
	</p>
	<p>“Esan? Ohh— you mean Esen—” Trina said, the confusion in her eyes subsided, and was replaced with a look of admiration, “that man is on the official team for sure. And he’s definitely not an errand boy—” she laughed, bewildered, “my gosh.”
	</p>
	<p>From the sudden burst of cheers and congratulations, Brontes guessed that the ceremony had ended and that the newly appointed officials of the R.A. had entered the room. 
	</p>
	<p>“See for yourself,” Trina pointed suddenly as she glanced towards the entrance, “there he is— Esen Ventus.”
	</p>
	<p>Brontes Laers felt his stomach drop as he turned around to have a good look— for as Trina had said— there the wind-rider was, standing in the center of a group of people, looking glorious in his new second-lieutenant-attire. 
	</p>
	<p class="pend">With an ivory cloak with green linings draped around his shoulders, all the while laughing with pure satisfaction— was Esen Ventus— the wind-rider who Brontes Laers had prayed that he would never have to meet again.
