			<h3><i>Tsahn Aouthyerhl</i></h3>
			<ul>
			<li>First son of the Great Chief of Clan Syarchia</li>
			<li>“Young prince of the hawk”</li>
			<li>Soft honey brown hair and sharp yellow hazel eyes</li>
			<li>Is gentle and kind. Introverted but counts as the most outgoing in the trio. Cheery around his friends. Smiles a lot. Like cute fuzzy things despite that it should be his nature to hunt them down and kill them (as a hawk)</li>
			<li>Often feels like he doesn’t belong. The place he can call home is where Candentia and Aurelius are.</li>
			<li>The magic of Land Hyacinthous, as well as the Southern powers run in his blood, as his mother was half Hyacinthousan</li>
			<li>Was sent to the Citadel of Annyo as a diplomatic hostage on a winter at the age of ten, two years before his sister was born</li>
			<li>Lived in the west wing of the Nix ever since his arrival to Annyo, where Candentia was arranged to live there after her 10th birthday, which was one year before his arrival.</li>
			<li>At the age of twelve, he was allowed to go back to his homeland with the migratory birds every autumn and stay there until winter has fallen in Land Hyacinthous</li>
			<li>Despite the two year gap of being far from home, Tsahn proved to be the same quick learner and within four years of time, including those spent at Annyo, he won the big hunting tournament that was held in Syarchia every summer at the young age of sixteen, surprising everyone, including his own father, as he left a timid and quiet child when he first left the clan.</li>
			<li>His best friends at home in Syarchia were a pair of twins, named Jethian And Jena, Jeth and Jen for short, whom Candentia adored when she went for a diplomatic visit to Syarchia.</li>
			<li>Candentia Hyacinth and Aurumnius Solicas were his soulmates, the people he loved the most, the ones he felt at home with. The  other two had known each other since the age of four, and after Tsahn arrived at Annyo and joined the other youngsters, they became a trio and had been inseparable ever since.</li>
			<li>Is to marry the first heir, supposedly, when they come of age. He does love the girl, but more of a way as a sibling, and the girl felt the same. He “loves,” loves Aurelius, who hasn’t a clue. (Candentia kinda had a crush on Aurelius throughout the years, but eventually gave up due to the toxiness of their relationship when it crossed the line of friendship when they tried— better to stay friends… and there’s the reality of her being the first heir… and she soon discovered that Tsahn also fell for Aurelius. Yup, so the two that were supposed to marry each other— both fell for the general’s son. So who does Aurelius like? One may ask… well… he never admitted it, but he did love Candentia when they were younger but stopped himself when he was mature enough to realize that she was to marry Tsahn. He thought the other two loved each other in that way and was bitter for a long time, well, dumb Aurie. He eventually tried to move on, but there was this unspoken rule that a lot of girls and boys disliked, which was no one—and he seriously meant that no one— could ever rise above Candentia and Tsahn in his heart— don’t ever think of it, it’s not going to happen. Well, dumb Aurelius, you should've told the two, imagine how happy they would be. )</li>
			<li>hmm… Tsahn has another secret power that he doesn't like— *Spoiler…so I deleted it on here hehe*</li>

			<h3><i>Aurelius Solicas</i></h3>
			<ul>
			<li>The first son of General Solicas</li>
			<li>His father, Erai Solicas, has been the best friend of King Hyacinth ever since they were a couple of teenagers. Erai became one of the most important generals and has been in charge of guarding the north for the past decade. Aurelius looked up to him and hoped to join the swordsmen department when he grows up. However</li>
			<li>Has a little brother, with the age gap of three years. Born in mid autumn.</li>
			<li>Raven-black hair and burnt-orange amber eyes</li>
			<li>Patient and well mannered. Quiet and cold, But quite gentle when you get to know him.</li>
			<li>Will do anything to protect Candentia and Tsahn. He is the oldest of the trio</li>
			<li>Despite the fierce competition between him and Candentia, they were seen everywhere together for many years. Enemy-like friends they were, but their bond was stronger than any other friends they have ever encountered. It was said that they were little soulmates who found each other the moment they met eyes. Needless to say, the story has been exaggerated by the palace people, and their encounter was nothing but simple. It was believed by the Queen that education must not be of discrimination, thus, the children of the royal staff and royal members attended no special school and were all demanded to keep their last names a secret to the teachers as they enrolled to the elementary school of crafts and skills of Annyo. As Aurie and Cady were both quiet children, one would think that it wasn’t likely that the two would become friends so naturally. It should be a force in the name of Resonance, that they somehow found each other on the sidelines. <br>
At the beginning of school, they both liked to sneak into the library during recess, and thus became acquainted. Gradually, they started sitting back to back with each other on the wooden bench by the window that overlooked the cherry blossoms, reading their time away. And after some time, the teachers discovered their absence and kinda forced them to join the playground. That was when the two started gaining attention from the little other classmates, and as you might guess, both of them became quite popular. They didn’t really talk much with each other when they were surrounded by people, not to mention in different groups, but they still would show up at the library after school. Sometimes, they would pack little boxes of snacks and share them under the willow trees by the crook, rambling about magic and fairy tales. They always liked to bicker and debate about, always trying to outsmart the other. The thing they agreed upon was to take care of Tsahn. When Tsahn came, they were told to look after the southern boy— Cady, by her parents, and Aurie, by his. It didn’t take long for them to take him under their wings in a serious matter, for the boy looked as frightened as a baby bird that had been thrown out of the nest before it learned how to fly, and they understood the feeling. Additionally, Tsahn was a pretty little thing, and they liked the way the hazel eyes would spill out honey whenever he smiled at them. They favored anything pretty, and they enjoyed the gaze of worship— just some other things they had in common.<br>
As they grew a little bit older, they both started taking martial arts and their performances more seriously, and were competing with each other all the time. Perfectness is what they strived for. And neither one of them was going to be left behind by the other. Their relationship deteriorated when they were just about fourteen…
And that’s a wrap. Story for another time.</li>
			<li>Fun fact: I was actually gonna name him “Aurumnius”</li>

			<h3><i>Shardow Gier</i></h3>
			<ul>
			<li>Caramel blond haired and forest green eyed</li>
			<li>An ordinary boy that lived on the outskirts of Annyo city</li>
			<li>He had two younger twin sisters, one younger brother, one older brother, and one older sister. Being the middle child of such a big family, he had the advantage to a large amount of freedom</li>
			<li>He met a mysterious, yet energetic girl in the woods one day when he was playing hide and seek with some friends. He invited the girl to join their games and the two became friends immediately after. The girl turned out to be the second heir to the Hyacinth throne. <br>
“You two know each other?” his friend, Akti Solicas, asked him in astonishment when he saw the girl in front of him.<br>
“You two know each other?” echoed the girl, Aestas, as she blinked in disbelief.<br>
“You two know each other?” Shardow was beyond puzzled, “I thought I was the only one bold enough to befriend a nobel decedent,” he patted Aestas on the back and said, “props to you, Aestas, you’re braver than I thought.”<br>
His friend Akti eyed him weirdly and said nothing.
</li>
			<li>“What?!” Shardow stumbled and fell as he cried out, “you are what? Aestas.”<br>
Aestas and Akti looked at eachother.<br>
“Akti? Aestas? Why didn’t you tell me the first time I introduced you to each other? You could’ve saved me from such trauma of finding out just now.”<br>
“I didn’t know someone could be so thick in the head to not know that the person in front of him was the princess,” Akti rolled his eyes.<br>
“Oooh, Akti, you cruel, cruel person,” Shardow shook his head dramatically. “And Aestas,” he said as he turned around facing the girl who had just burst out laughing, “you are no good either.”</li>

			<h3><i>Lansher Coulnaur Hellebore</i></h3>
			<ul>
			<li>First son of the King of Hellebore</li>
			<li>Gray eyes and ivory hair (natural color) he and Candentia both dyed their hair ombre gray when they escaped to the Southern Lands.</li>
			<li>The first lieutenant of the R.E.D. — Hashier Coulnaur(45), is actually of Hellebore bloodline— his name was Coulnaur Hellebore, older brother to the recent king of Hellebore. He got kicked out of the North And Lansher’s middle name is named after him.<br>
Plot twist: *bc of spoilers, deleted here*  /  LOOOOL</li>
			<li>The younger brother to a pair of  twin sisters, Henitah and Jashi, with the age gap of one and a half years</li>
			<li>Younger cousin of Candentia Hyacinth, with the age gap of one year. The two had similar birthdays with Candentia’s being on the third and Lansher’s on the last, of seven-day long-festival — “The celebration of Winter light,” which was actually called a different name in The North — “the celebration of Northern lights.” Well, “tomato, tomato.”
</li>
			<li>“It’s like looking into not only a mirror, but three,” was what he said to the Hyacinthous trio when they all finally stood face to face, with masks and veils off, which the other three protested against. And to which he said, “well, now that you mentioned it, we’re nothing alike, I’m the most popular amongst this group.” The statement, of which two of the members of the trio strongly disagreed (you can easily guess who didn’t care at all),  led to a contest in the Tricheri that night to see who of the four got the most flowers from the customers, regardless of gender. Legends say it was the most unforgettable night for the people of Kantenti. The matriarch of The Tricheri was delighted to see an upwards swerve of income for the next five days, and doubled all their payments. Tsahn really wanted nothing to do with this, but was happy that he got more money in the end.</li>
			<li>After the North had been under the Bounding enchantment cast by royal enchanters of the capital of land Hyacinthous, its people could only exit through ships, which were under constant surveillance of both the royal swordsmen and the royal windriders. The Hellebores never once traveled out of the North, though permission to cross the border was granted three years after the fall of the old king, who was Lansher's Grandfather. His father, a person the young Hellebore heirs relied on and looked up to, had forbidden them to leave the North. </li>
