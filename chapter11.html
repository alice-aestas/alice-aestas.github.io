	<h2 class="chapter title">Burnt amber and Icy daggers</h2>
<div class="chaptercontent">
	<p><b class="b">T</b>he strong locking spell bounding the heavy doors from the inside was broken down, and several swordsmen burst through the door, followed by a furious looking king and worried queen.
	</p>
	<p>“What have you done?!” the king murmured.
	</p>
	<p>“I—” Candentia looked dazed.
	</p>
	<p>“Speak up,” he said calmly, “tell us what happened.”
	</p>
	<p>The little girl fidgeted and opened her mouth to speak. However, no words came out.
	</p>
	<p><b>“Estive!”</b> the queen cried out to her husband. She had kelt down next to Tsahn, and was inspecting the other boy that had collapsed on top of him, “it’s Erai’s child, Aurelius!” She picked the boy up and set him down gently on his side. A breath was drawn sharply upon the sight of the severely wounded back. “He’s hurt! Estive!” she called out frantically, “his back is cut, and I fear from the color and smell, that the knife had poison on it— And the shape of the wound— it’s as if he was bitten by a…”
	</p>
	<p>“Two of you. Take the child to the infirmary. Now!” the king commanded his swordsmen, “and you,” he pointed at another, “run down to district Barue and send for the toxicologist squad immediately. Inform them that an eleven year-old boy has been slashed in the back, possibly with a poisonous object.”
	</p>
	<p>“Snake venom,” said queen Merythdian suddenly, “and it must’ve been a double-fanged knife— the ones that the people of clan Echis are famous for.” She had lifted the hood of the foreign man, who had collapsed before her daughter’s feet, revealing his identity. A group of envoys had just arrived from the southern lands a few days ago, and the man was one of them, coming from clan Echis— one of the clans that live by the power of viper snakes. 
	</p>
	<p>Blood drenched his long cloak and he lay in a bizarre position on the floor motionlessly, barely breathing.
	</p>
	<p>“Take <i>him</i> to the envoys’ infirmary,” the king instructed, “make sure he receives immediate medical attention, and keep him chained up. I will deal with him later,” He gestured for the guards to take the limp body away. The queen jumped slightly when the dead bodies of two snakes tumbled out of the pockets of the Echis man’s damp cloak. 
	</p>
	<p>The guards hastily cleaned up the mess and took the injured out the door, leaving the king, queen Merythdian, and the other two kids alone in the spacious ballroom.
	</p>
	<p>“Now can you tell us what happened?” the queen asked her daughter, after the guards had left. “Who hurt Aurelius? And the man?”
	</p>
	<p>“I—, he—, they—,” the girl stuttered. Her hand that held the dagger started to tremble.
	</p>
	<p>“It’s alright, dear,” her mother said patiently, “take a deep breath and speak clearly so that we can understand.”
	</p>
	<p>“I—, I—” the young Candentia stammered, gray almond eyes wide.
	</p>
	<p>“<i>PUT THAT DAGGER AWAY THIS INSTANCE AND SPEAK UP CLEARLY!</i>” the king bellowed suddenly.
	</p>
	<p>The little girl flinched and dropped the bloody object in her hand, it crashed and shattered to pieces upon contact with the floor— it was made of ice. 
	</p>
	<p>“What were you doing in these halls?” the queen soothed, “these halls were closed up for construction. And I thought you knew better than to break the rules, hmm?” She helped the young southern boy up. The boy sobbed quietly and squirmed out of the queen’s grasp; small body trembling as he staggered towards the pillar where his pet hawk lay limply, both wings broken.
	</p>
	<p>“Don’t die,” Tsahn whimpered, picking the creature up and stroking it gently.
	</p>
	<p>The young Candentia started rushing toward Tsahn, but was jerked back with harsh force. “Answer your mother’s question,” her father’s voice thundered, “why were you wandering about, when you were supposed to go back to your chambers right after your classes at the academy?”
	</p>
	<p>Candentia whimpered, “I—” her eyes teared up, but she held her breath and strained to prevent them from falling, she glanced at Tsahn. She had followed the screeches of his pet hawk and caught a glimpse of the southern boy just before he had disappeared into the room. 
	</p>
	<p>If she told the truth, would the southern boy be punished? or would he be thrown out of the castle? She bit her lip when the glossy hazel eyes of the other gazed back at her with fear. No, she could never let that happen. 
	</p>
	<p>“I wanted to play hide and seek,” she lied in a small voice, “and I brought Tsahn and Aurelius here with me.”
	</p>
	<p>“Is this what you were taught to do?” the king snarled, holding firmly to her arm.
	</p>
	<p>“No,” she answered in a quivering voice, “but I didn’t know there would be someone—”
	</p>
	<p>“Don’t test my fucking patience,” the king cut in. Anger spilled out of his green eyes, “are you aware of what you might’ve destroyed today?”
	</p>
	<p>“I didn’t know— ”  
	</p>
	<p>“You didn’t know,” her father breathed, “that by bringing your little friends here, you put their lives on the line?”
	</p>
	<p>“I—”
	</p>
	<p>“That’s not all,” he continued, “even if it was self defense, did you not know that by stabbing an envoy, and nearly killing him, you could ruin the alliance our people worked so hard for? Not only did you stab the man, you used the forbidden powers for the weapons.”
	</p>
	<p class="p">Normally, the powers of the Hyacinthous people should be of controlling their surroundings, and not producing. It was documented that those who stray far from the characteristics of Hyacinthous magic, often run mad, eventually destroying, or more worse—killing— those who crossed paths with them. 
	</p>
	<p>“Meteors,” an object of burning hell and fallen grace, had become the appellative for their kind. And for the first heir of Land Hyacinthous to show any signs of the sort was a bad omen. 
	</p>
	<p>Ever since Candentia’s parents found out that their eldest daughter was capable of producing icy weapons out of thin air, they were terrified. There were multiple attempts to coax the rare but dangerous power out of the child when she was younger, but all in vain. Candentia Hyacinth was then forbidden to let the aggressive powers that flowed in her veins show, not mentioning using them. 
	</p>
	<p>It was the only consolation to the throne that their second heir was, thankfully, full of the right magic ever since birth; a bright and adorable girl, completely absent of the chilling aura that occasionally leaked out of her older sister.
	</p>
	<p class="p">“How many rules were you going to break?” The king’s tone was grave; he tightened his grasp as a warning, to which Candentia writhed in pain. 
	</p>
	<p>“But— Tsahn was in grave danger!” she protested still, her voice choked up, “I didn’t have a choice—”
	</p>
	<p>“Don’t talk back to your father like that, dear,” queen Merythdian stopped her, voice gentle but stern. 
	</p>
	<p><i>He could’ve been killed</i>, Candentia wanted to tell them, but swallowed the words painfully, obeying her mother.
	</p>
	<p>“Think about what you have done,” the king let go of the child, but she stayed frozen, “your recklessness risked not only multiple lives, including your own, but also brought great hazard to the throne’s honor.”
	</p>
	<p>The king was as confused as he was angry. He had been alerted that there was an attempted attack on some children in the halls of the main castle. And his face thundered with shadows when he learned who were the possible victims— the names reported to him were some of the ones he feared to be the most: the son of the clan Syarchia Chief, the son of lieutenant-general Solicas, and one of his own daughters. Either one of them being hurt or killed could possibly be one of the worst nightmares to the country, especially the two that were bloodlines of the most powerful families. 
	</p>
	<p>The king had rushed out of his daily meeting with the royal enchanters, and followed the guard who led him to the place the children were last seen. 
	</p>
	<p>The door of one of the huge ballrooms had been locked from the inside with a strong foreign spell. And as two young enchanters tried frantically to break the spell, little shouts of terror could be heard from the other side. The king listened in fear as he waited patiently for the enchanters to do their job.
	</p>
	<p><b><i>“Tsahn—! Run!”</i></b>
	</p>
	<p>It was Candentia’s tender cry.
	</p>
	<p class="p">The timeline of this particular dream was a mess— jumping from one time frame to another; sometimes in sequence, sometimes in reverse; while some scenes overlapped with one another, happening simultaneously in different corners.
	</p>
	<p>Confused by the strange yet familiar incidents, Aurelius searched the room full of dream fragments for an answer. He noticed that in one of the corners, a tall, slim man lurked behind a pillar of the empty halls and was hissing softly, facing a hawk with spreaded wings. The hawk, which Aurelius realized, was the one that never left Tsahn’s side when the young boy first arrived at the citadel. Aurelius furrowed his eyebrows, recalling how he never saw it again since around that time. 
	</p>
	<p class="p">The hawk let out high pitched screeches, wings beating strongly against the air, its foot caught in a trap. The tall man behind the pillar grabbed onto its neck and backed into an empty ballroom. Rapid footsteps of a child followed behind. It was the young Aouthyerhl.
	</p>
	<p class="p">“This is bloody trauma,” Candor Nyek said in a low voice, his hand grasping Aurelius, who looked as if his soul had left the body. “Complete chaos,” Candor breathed, “is this something that really happened?”
	</p>
	<p>“I—” Aurelius murmured, “I don’t remember…”
	</p>
	<p>He did remember the part where he raced after Tsahn, into the dark ballroom, with Candentia by his side— but his memory could only stretch that far.
	</p>
	<p class="p">The class, apart from Tsahn, who’s eyelids were shut, sat on the edge of their seats and stared— alarmed; while multiple dark shapes hurled around them, barging aimlessly from one end of the room to the other. Blood had drained out of Aurelius’ face long ago, and he felt light-headed, overwhelmed by the desperate cries. The metallic smell of weapons and blood flowed; though light, it flooded his senses, and the back of his hand came into contact with his nose as he furrowed his brows, nauseous. The dream fragments had formed distinctive figures in shapes and colors so vivid, it felt as if they were real; Aurelius watched with dread as Tsahn’s nightmare unfolded before his eyes. 
	</p>
	<p>The king couldn’t see, but on the other side of the room, a tall slim man in a hooded black cloak with purple linings hurled a small knife, with two fang-like blades sticking out its front, at the young prince of Syarchia, who scrambled behind a pillar just in time to dodge the attack. 
	</p>
	<p>The young boy had rushed into the room, following the desperate screeches of the hawk he brought from his homeland, and had realized in terror that a tall, hooded man stood awaiting him. He gave a terrified shriek when the man came leaping at him; two snakes shot out from under the long sleeves, their fangs dripping with venom. The man noticed two other small shadows dashing in the room and stopped in his tracks, alarmed. He let out a hushed chuckle when he realized that they were only children— kids he had never seen before. He set off his snakes in their direction, as he went over and bound the doors with a spell, before creeping slowly, closer to his main target without a sound.
	</p>
	<p>He was almost close enough in range for a strike when a shout from the little girl came shooting from across the room.
	</p>
	<p><b><i>“Tsahn! Run!”</i></b> she shrieked.
	</p>
	<p>“Candentia!” The Syarchia prince scrambled towards the source of her voice. He had only known the Hyacinth princess for less than a year, but had already learned the sound of her footsteps and the frequency of her voice by heart.
	</p>
	<p>As he ran mindlessly, a small figure suddenly appeared out of nowhere, and he felt a pair of small hands shove him aside. 
	</p>
	<p>Tsahn stumbled and fell, rolling to a hard thud as his back hit the wall. He cried out in pain and tried to climb back on his feet.
	</p>
	<p>“Stay back,” a childish voice of a boy sounded. It was Erai Solicas’ first son. Erai Solicas, a close friend of Candentia’s parents, was still lieutenant-general of the R.S.D. back then. 
	</p>
	<p>The young boy had leapt out from the shadows, flinging out a short sword, causing the attacker to jump aside in surprise; Tsahn had been pushed out of danger just in time to be saved from yet another plunge of the hooded man.
	</p>
	<p>“Aurelius!” the little Tsahn called out frantically. 
	</p>
	<p>“Stay back,” Aurelius said again, left hand signaling Tsahn to stay hidden, while his eyes were trained on something. 
	</p>
	<p>Tsahn crawled forward and peeked out from behind a pillar. He trembled as he watched two venomous viper snakes slither toward Aurelius, who held a defensive position, preparing for the strike. 
	</p>
	<p>Aurelius took a step to the side, using his small body to block the snakes’ sight of their prey. The young boy from Syarchia was a fragile child back then, for he was clumsy and weak, and knew nothing about combat and self defense; without protection, he would’ve fallen prey to any larger creatures, and with that special bloodline of his, it made the boy a valuable target to the enemy. Aurelius, on the other hand, had been under combat training since he could hold a sword. However, this was the first time he ever had to face a real enemy, and he was scared.
	</p>
	<p>“Duck and run when you can,” Aurelius shouted to Tsahn as he lunged towards one of the snakes, blade flashing. The other snake slashed its fangs at him and he dodged out of the way just in time, all the while whirling the sword to create a shield. 
	</p>
	<p>Tsahn, keeping Aurelius’ words in mind, saw his opportunity and dashed towards the door. A dark shadow, however, loomed suddenly from behind a pillar across the room, and yet another weapon came whirling at Tsahn. He gave yelp and tripped, flinging himself on the floor, dodging out of the way with sheer luck.
	</p>
	<p>The knife struck the gray marble and fell to the floor with a clunk. The tall man let out a snake-like hiss, and lurked towards the young Syarchia prince, who whimpered as he crawled backwards. 
	</p>
	<p>The boy’s back hit yet another pillar and he cried out weakly in despair.
	</p>
	<p>“No,” he pleaded, his face smeared with dirt as salty water leaked out from his eyes and nose, down his dusty face, and into his mouth. “Don’t hurt me, please,” he gasped.
	</p>
	<p>The slim figure let out a chilling snicker and plunged at the little boy. If he got rid of the Syarchia heir once and for all, their antagonizing clan, which had grown stronger than ever over the years, would definitely crumble, and clan Echis might just have the chance to rise above their long term enemy.
	</p>
	<p>An image of his parents suddenly appeared in Tsahn’s mind, smiling at him ever so warmly. A sharp pang of sorrow gripped his thundering heart as he squeezed his eyes shut, accepting his fate.
	</p>
	<p class="p">The squelching of blades sticking into flesh sounded.
	</p>
	<p>Then everything was still.
	</p>
	<p class="p">Silence.
	</p>
	<p class="p">To his astonishment, instead of pain, Tsahn felt the weight of a body collapse on top of him. His eyes, when the warmth of the body came into contact, shot open. He watched in terror as Aurelius’ limp body was lifted up slightly when the hooded man hissed and pulled out the blade that stuck to the boy’s back. 
	</p>
	<p>“Aurelius!” Tsahn gasped, realizing that the other had flung himself in between the action and shielded him from the fatal blow, uttering not even a sound when he fell. Tsahn held tight to Aurelius and tried to drag him backwards, away from the man who raised his knife again— the two blades, slightly bent in an arch, dripped with a yellowish liquid that sizzled as it dripped to the floor.
	</p>
	<p>“Go away, please!” the young Tsahn shrieked at the man, who merely sneered, baring his teeth. 
	</p>
	<p>Tsahn whimpered in fear as the knife flashed. 
	</p>
	<p>The man, however, froze— with a bony hand still raised. He wore a shocked expression as glanced down to his side— a dagger, transparent and freezing cold, was stuck into his flesh. 
	</p>
	<p>He staggered and coughed as a little girl pulled out the blade with a swift moment. And before he could react, he felt another sharp blow to his stomach, the icy blade sliced his intestines as it was turned harshly, churning through his organs before it was pulled out once again. 
	</p>
	<p>The young Candentia used her whole body and charged with full force, pushing the tall man away from the boys. The double bladed knife in the man’s hand hit the floor, rattling, as he stumbled and collapsed to the floor; his hands held the wounds as he moaned in pain.
	</p>
	<p class="p">Back in the front of the classroom, Tsahn Aouthyerhl lay restlessly, tied to the bench. He held a painful expression, brows knitted together, as he murmured frantically, stirring in his sleep. Although his words were drowned out by the howling of the dark shadows that swirled the room, Kye Anek could guess what he was saying, suddenly realizing that this must be the nightmare the southern boy was talking about; a wave of guilt and shame washed over him. 
	</p>
	<p>“Solicas!” the shrill voice of professor Coulnaur suddenly sounded above the chaos, “you were told to stay seated until the storm has passed.”
	</p>
	<p>The general’s son, with his amber eyes gleaming fiercely, had climbed over his desk, and was making his way down the steps, dodging and slashing at the dark shapes that lunged at him. 
	</p>
	<p>“Don’t you dare wake him up with force,” the professor sounded alarmed, “it might do him permanent damage, considering the intensity of the enchantment.”
	</p>
	<p>“I won’t hurt him,” Aurelius Solicas promised coldly as he brushed past his professor and stepped onto the stage.
	</p><br>
	<p class="p">“Tsahn!” 
	</p>
	<p>A girl in a soft sage-colored dress flung herself at Tshan, who caught her steadily. The sixteen year old had rushed to the Nix after hearing that the primary trainees had completed the last ceremony of the winter program, and were free to go home.
	</p>
	<p>“It’s been a while, little one,” Tsahn said softly, smiling down at the girl in his arms, “have you grown taller?” 
	</p>
	<p>She nodded but said nothing, burying her face in his shawl, forehead resting slightly on his shoulder. Tsahn put a gentle hand on the back of her head and smiled to himself— she had grown taller over the season. 
	</p>
	<p>Aestas held tight to Tsahn’s cloak and breathed a long sigh.
	</p>
	<p>“I missed you, too,” Tshan let out a low, soothing chuckle that made her heart flutter. This particular winter was the far most agonizing and lonely one Aestas had to go through, and she missed the warmth of his company.
	</p>
	<p>She pulled herself back after a moment and glanced up, studying his face. He looked about the same as she remembered, but his aura— it was… different. More sophisticated, and peaceful, resembling the quiet after a raging storm had passed.
	</p>
	<p>“I heard that there was an accident in enchantment training,” she said, face lifted and full of concern.
	</p>
	<p>Gentle laughter spilled out of his honeyed-eyes as he gazed back into the lime-green ones.
	</p>
	<p>“That was a long while ago,” he mused, “almost at the start of the program.”
	</p>
	<p>He picked up the small bag of luggage that had been previously dropped to the floor and made his way upstairs. Aestas tagged along, just a few steps behind him.
	</p>
	<p>“I know,” she pouted, “but are you alright? I heard that you got messed up.”
	</p>
	<p><i>“How embarrassing,”</i> he said jokingly, though his brows were furrowed, “that even the princess heard about it.”
	</p>
	<p>Tsahn trailed his fingers lightly along the handrails. The wooden surface was smooth and spotless. Even in the absence of its main residents, the Nix seemed to have been taken with care.
	</p>
	<p>“I only know because I attended most of the R.A. meetings the past winter,” Aestas explained as she caught up beside Tsahn.
	</p>
	<p>She went on, following him through the corridor leading to their rooms. “Hashier Coulnaur got a warning for teaching dream extraction in his class. General Sulvin called him a mad scientist in front of all the officials at the meeting.”
	</p>
	<p>“Did he?” Tsahn laughed softly, recalling the image of the bad tempered, old mage. Arcani Sulvin, who used to have red hair that had turned gray and white over the years, has been the general of the Royal Enchanters Department for over fifteen years; even though he was already in his late sixties, he still holds the temper and energy of a wild mare. 
	</p>
	<p>“Just between you and me,” Aestas whispered, “I don’t think Mother likes him, either. Hashier Coulnaur, I mean—”
	</p>
	<p>Tsahn raised his eyebrows, “is that so?”
	</p>
	<p>“Yes,” she giggled slightly, “she considers the man a bit crazy.”
	</p>
	<p>“Well,” Tsahn laughed softly, “she’s not wrong, though. A lot of the trainees would agree. He seems like the type that doesn’t usually play by the rules.”
	</p>
	<p>“I know, right?” Aestas giggled before stopping for a moment. She continued in a hushed voice, after making sure that they were alone in the hall, “father likes him, though. He wanted to promote Coulnaur to a higher position several times, but Mother and general Sulvin both strongly disagreed against the proposal, saying that the man doesn’t play by the rules, like you said, and would be difficult to control.”
	</p>
	<p>Tsahn smiled sympathetically, “that explains. We were wondering why a man of such talent and power had been stuck in the first lieutenant position for so long.”
	</p>
	<p>“Well,” Aestas said blandly, “you know how things are.”
	</p>
	<p>Tsahn ran a finger over the wooden carvings of his bedroom door, and let out a small sigh. It really has been a while since he saw home. He glanced sideways at the younger. She held an exuberant demeanor, and her face shone bright with energy, but thinking of what the girl had gone through, Tsahn was still concerned.
	</p>
	<p>“Are things better or worse between them? If you don’t mind me asking,” he said softly.
	</p>
	<p>Aestas fidgetted. She hadn’t really been that much around her parents to understand their recent dynamics. Most of the time when she was in the same room with them both, it was during public occasions, where the king and queen would behave as if everything was fine.
	</p>
	<p>Tsahn noticed her hesitance and changed the question, “how are you doing? I heard that you are staying at the main castle. Do you get much sleep these days?”
	</p>
	<p>Aestas smiled to herself when Tsahn tossed his baggage into the room and stayed with her in the hall. She had to refrain herself from hugging him.
	</p>
	<p>“Yes,” she replied, “I’m actually sleeping well these days.” 
	</p>
	<p>It was true. The soft bed at the main castle was familiar, reminding her of the old days when she and her sister shared the room, giving her a weird sense of comfort. Her heart suddenly scrunched up, however, in the moment, numb pain spreading out at the thought of her sister. 
	</p>
	<p>The absence of the older made the winter far more difficult than it had been to bear. Aestas took in a slow breath and pushed the older out of her mind.
	</p>
	<p>“You?” she turned to ask Tsahn.
	</p>
	<p>It was his turn to fidget.
	</p>
	<p>“Yea— good,” he lied, while a hand reached up to flick the corner of his right eye, “fairly, I suppose. No nightmares or anything.”
	</p>
	<p>“Really?” 
	</p>
	<p>She was skeptical.
	</p>
	<p>“Really.” 
	</p>
	<p>His tone was certain. 
	</p>
	<p>He showed her a bright smile— warm as the sun, and Aestas melted, believing him. She was glad— relieved, even. For she had feared the possibility of the older boy being torn from the strict training of the winter program, especially considering the condition he was in when he left. 
	</p>
	<p>Aestas observed the other, taking in the figure of the young man leaning with his back against the wall. He did look better, healthier, and somehow different, with his honeyed strands the longest she had ever seen, almost covering his ears and the back of his neck. He also seemed stronger, with his muscles evidently more toned, which she had already noticed the moment they reunited. 
	</p>
	<p>“You worked hard,” she blurted out suddenly, “despite everything that happened.”
	</p>
	<p>He blinked slowly, taken by surprise. “Thanks?” 
	</p>
	<p>“No, I mean—” she strained, trying not to sound arrogant, “it must have been hard for you to go under training alone at a place where your name is known by most of your peers and teachers.”
	</p>
	<p>Tsahn Aouthyerhl immediately thought of the first few weeks of the program, when he had been on a bed of thorns, with people such as Kye Anek nipping at his heels. He chuckled softly, despite himself.
	</p>
	<p>“And Aurelius,” Aestas started, hesitating whether or not she should mention the name. She observed Tshan’s face as he tilted his head in inquiry— no sign of agitation could be detected. 
	</p>
	<p>“I heard that he also joined the program,” she continued cautiously, “it must be difficult, being in the same room with him after that fight you had.”
	</p>
	<p>Tsahn merely chuckled.
	</p>
	<p>“Did you run into him there?” Aestas asked.
	</p>
	<p>“Yup, I did,” Tsahn replied lightly, “and I guess we kind of made up.”
	</p>
	<p>“You did?” Aestas exclaimed, delighted, “that’s wonderful! Oh— I’m so glad.”
	</p>
	<p>“Don’t get your hopes up though,” Tsahn warned hurriedly, “we didn’t actually talk much during the program.”
	</p>
	<p>The truth was, he wasn’t sure whether Aurelius Solicas still considered him a friend. They never really had a chance for a long conversation during the course of their training.
	</p>
	<p class="p">The incident of the Tsahn’s raging nightmare that day in the classroom gradually ended with him waking up to Aurelius’ low singing. The general’s son had sat on the floor, with his back leaning against the bench, dark shadows darting around him all the while. He sat peacefully in the eye of the storm and hummed softly— a tune the sleeping boy had taught Candentia and him when they were younger; a simple but sweet Syarchia song. 
	</p>
	<p>Tsahn had opened his eyes, sight slightly blurred. He trembled, but felt rather comforted by the low melody. 
	</p>
	<p>Whispers spread out the room as the darkness subsided, and light slanted through the windows once again as the curtains slid apart. Tsahn knew from the touch that it was Aurelius who undid the straps and freed him from the bench. 
	</p>
	<p>“Welcome back, Aouthyerhl,” It was professor Coulnaur’s soft voice that sounded. “You did well—” he was being earnest.
	</p>
	<p>“You can rest for a bit while the class takes a break,” the professor said, “I’m sorry that you had to go through that. Be sure to inform me if you feel any discomfort or if headaches happen.”
	</p>
	<p>Tsahn covered his eyes with his right arm and let out a waverly sigh, his lips quivering as he tried to tell his professor that he was alright. 
	</p>
	<p>“Should I take him to the infirmary?” Aurelius’ low voice sounded.
	</p>
	<p>“That’s suitable,” the professor furrowed his eyebrows, “if Mr. Aouthyerhl here prefers that.”
	</p>
	<p>Tsahn sat himself up slowly, hands gripping the side of the bench. Although he was worn out, he felt rather fine. It was merely a nightmare after all.
	</p>
	<p>“I’m fine,” he managed to croak out, setting his feet on the floor. He lifted his face and squeezed out a smile, “I’m alright. I’m used to these nightmares. They happen all the time. It’s nothing, really.” 
	</p>
	<p>“Tsahn…” his professor murmured.
	</p>
	<p>Tsahn noticed in confusion that the people around him, including professor Coulnaur, Aurelius, and some classmates in the front row, were all staring at him with stunned looks on their faces. It wasn’t long until he noticed the damp feeling of tears running down his cheeks and dripping down his chin.
	</p>
	<p>“What— I—” he stammered, shocked, “shit— this is not—”
	</p>
	<p>His vision was suddenly blocked, as whispers of soft, musky amber consumed his senses. A cloak had been flung over his head and he was pulled roughly to his feet. 
	</p>
	<p>“Infirmary,” he heard Aurelius say, before feeling a firm, yet gentle grip on his arm. The professor, who nodded, granting his permission, watched with subtle amusement as Tsahn Aouthyerhl stumbled blindly, but obediently, behind Aurelius Solicas, who dragged his fellow trainee out of the classroom rather aggressively. The sight of the grown boys reminded him of the time when they were much younger, and he smiled.
	</p>
	<p class="p">Tsahn felt his chest tighten at the memory of Aurelius’ back, shielding him, once again, from the showering bullets. The boy had led Tsahn through paths paved with sharp thorns, and out of the darkness numerous times already. 
	</p>
	<p>Despite the cold aura, Aurelius Solicas resembled the autumn rain that drenched the world in soft, shimmering gold; he was like a calm breeze that brought with him the honeyed scent of whisper-layered amber. And his gaze that held burnt flames— was silent but strong, with every slow blink sending ripples through quiet ponds. 
	</p>
	<p>With a start of realization, Tsahn suddenly recalled that the conversation in the infirmary that day was actually the last time Aurelius spoke to him directly in public. 
	</p>
	<p>“So the two of you still haven’t come around?” Aestas asked, crestfallen, as she watched Tsahn nibble his bottom lip.
	</p>
	<p>“Oh— how I would love to smack Aurelius in the head for being so stubborn,” she slithered, “are you alright, Tsahn?”
	</p>
	<p>“Don’t you worry about me, little one,” Tsahn laughed, reaching out to ruffle her hair, “at least he doesn’t want to kill me anymore, I suppose” he joked, “to be fair, I did hurl a dagger at him in the first place. And I also lashed out at him again, even though he saved me from being stuck in a nightmare.”
	</p>
	<p class="pend"> “Tsahn…” Aestas was speechless.
