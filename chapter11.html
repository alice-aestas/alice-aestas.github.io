	<h2 class="chapter title">Burnt amber and Icy daggers</h2>
<div class="chaptercontent">
	<p><b class="b">T</b>he strong locking spell bounding the heavy doors from the inside was broken down, and several swordsmen burst through the door, followed by a furious looking king and worried queen.
	</p>
	<p>“What have you done?!” the king murmured.
	</p>
	<p>“I—” Candentia looked dazed.
	</p>
	<p>“Speak up,” he said calmly, “tell us what happened.”
	</p>
	<p>The little girl fidgeted and opened her mouth to speak. However, no words came out.
	</p>
	<p><b>“Estive!”</b> the queen cried out to her husband. She had kelt down next to Tsahn, and was inspecting the other boy that had collapsed on top of him, “it’s Erai’s child, Aurelius!” She picked the boy up and set him down gently on his side. A breath was drawn sharply upon the sight of the severely wounded back. “He’s hurt! Estive!” she called out frantically, “his back is cut, and I fear from the color and smell, that the knife had poison on it— And the shape of the wound— it’s as if he was bitten by a…”
	</p>
	<p>“Two of you. Take the child to the infirmary. Now!” the king commanded his swordsmen, “and you,” he pointed at another, “run down to district Barue and send for the toxicologist squad immediately. Inform them that an eleven year-old boy has been slashed in the back, possibly with a poisonous object.”
	</p>
	<p>“Snake venom,” said queen Merythdian suddenly, “and it must’ve been a double-fanged knife— the ones that the people of clan Echis are famous for.” She had lifted the hood of the foreign man, who had collapsed before her daughter’s feet, revealing his identity. A group of envoys had just arrived from the southern lands a few days ago, and the man was one of them, coming from clan Echis— one of the clans that live by the power of viper snakes. 
	</p>
	<p>Blood drenched his long cloak and he lay in a bizarre position on the floor motionlessly, barely breathing.
	</p>
	<p>“Take <i>him</i> to the envoys’ infirmary,” the king instructed, “make sure he receives immediate medical attention, and keep him chained up. I will deal with him later,” He gestured for the guards to take the limp body away. The queen jumped slightly when the dead bodies of two snakes tumbled out of the pockets of the Echis man’s damp cloak. 
	</p>
	<p>The guards hastily cleaned up the mess and took the injured out the door, leaving the king, queen Merythdian, and the other two kids alone in the spacious ballroom.
	</p>
	<p>“Now can you tell us what happened?” the queen asked her daughter, after the guards had left. “Who hurt Aurelius? And the man?”
	</p>
	<p>“I—, he—, they—,” the girl stuttered. Her hand that held the dagger started to tremble.
	</p>
	<p>“It’s alright, dear,” her mother said patiently, “take a deep breath and speak clearly so that we can understand.”
	</p>
	<p>“I—, I—” the young Candentia stammered, gray almond eyes wide.
	</p>
	<p>“<i>PUT THAT DAGGER AWAY THIS INSTANCE AND SPEAK UP CLEARLY!</i>” the king bellowed suddenly.
	</p>
	<p>The little girl flinched and dropped the bloody object in her hand, it crashed and shattered to pieces upon contact with the floor— it was made of ice. 
	</p>
	<p>“What were you doing in these halls?” the queen soothed, “these halls were closed up for construction. And I thought you knew better than to break the rules, hmm?” She helped the young southern boy up. The boy sobbed quietly and squirmed out of the queen’s grasp; small body trembling as he staggered towards the pillar where his pet hawk lay limply, both wings broken.
	</p>
	<p>“Don’t die,” Tsahn whimpered, picking the creature up and stroking it gently.
	</p>
	<p>The young Candentia started rushing toward Tsahn, but was jerked back with harsh force. “Answer your mother’s question,” her father’s voice thundered, “why were you wandering about, when you were supposed to go back to your chambers right after your classes at the academy?”
	</p>
	<p>Candentia whimpered, “I—” her eyes teared up, but she held her breath and strained to prevent them from falling, she glanced at Tsahn. She had followed the screeches of his pet hawk and caught a glimpse of the southern boy just before he had disappeared into the room. 
	</p>
	<p>If she told the truth, would the southern boy be punished? or would he be thrown out of the castle? She bit her lip when the glossy hazel eyes of the other gazed back at her with fear. No, she could never let that happen. 
	</p>
	<p>“I wanted to play hide and seek,” she lied in a small voice, “and I brought Tsahn and Aurelius here with me.”
	</p>
	<p>“Is this what you were taught to do?” the king snarled, holding firmly to her arm.
	</p>
	<p>“No,” she answered in a quivering voice, “but I didn’t know there would be someone—”
	</p>
	<p>“Don’t test my fucking patience,” the king cut in. Anger spilled out of his green eyes, “are you aware of what you might’ve destroyed today?”
	</p>
	<p>“I didn’t know— ”  
	</p>
	<p>“You didn’t know,” her father breathed, “that by bringing your little friends here, you put their lives on the line?”
	</p>
	<p>“I—”
	</p>
	<p>“That’s not all,” he continued, “even if it was self defense, did you not know that by stabbing an envoy, and nearly killing him, you could ruin the alliance our people worked so hard for? Not only did you stab the man, you used the forbidden powers for the weapons.”
	</p>
	<p class="p">Normally, the powers of the Hyacinthous people should be of controlling their surroundings, and not producing. It was documented that those who stray far from the characteristics of Hyacinthous magic, often run mad, eventually destroying, or more worse—killing— those who crossed paths with them.
