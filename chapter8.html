<div class="chaptercontent">
	<p><b class="b">D</b>own by the bay, calls and shouts from the sea punctured their way through the faraway mist, announcing the first arrival of the morning merchant ships. The ships slowly sailed into the harbor, and gradually stopped beside the docks— where cargo is supposed to be loaded on and off the vessels— their large white sails flapped wildly against the wind. With a splash— the anchor was dropped, and along with the shimmering clear bubbles, it gradually sunk into the deep, dark blue. A shout— followed by groups of men and women awaiting— rushed towards the dock and the crew worked in pairs to help discharge the cargo.
	</p>
	<p>Aestas wrapped the cloak more tightly around her shivering body as she walked against the cold sea wind of the morning. The early winter wind plunged towards land, shoving the fog which had been hovering the surface of the waters in the process, pushing the gray white mist further and further into the shores below Annyo city. The damp smell of newly captured fish and shrimp, along with the saltiness of the sea water, wafted its way into the harbor and feathered out the hills. Aestas licked her lips— it was as though she could taste the salt that lingered in the air.  
	</p>
	<p>She walked quickly along the stone-paved path, and soon, on her right, aligning on the waters by the dock, were about twelve small, light-weight boats, just slightly visible to the eye, regarding the fogginess of the morning. The glossy chestnut brown of the hulls were made of “Wesry wood,” which were cut from the trees in the forest situated at the east of the citadel. The snow-white sails that usually flew, open and wide, were furled at the moment, and the bundles were bobbing up and down against the steady rhythm of the waves. 
	</p>
	<p>Aestas squatted down on the edge of the port and gazed absentmindedly at the metal badges embedded near the bows, on the side of the boat. The badges, crafted with meticulous care, indicate that these vessels belong to the Royal Windriders Department of Land Hyacinthous. 
	</p>
	<p>Listening to the slapping of the waves, Aestas couldn't help but let currents of memory wash over her. She remembered now, standing by the boats, of how in the summer, the Windriders steered the fleet, riding the waves and controlling the winds— Esen Ventus, the handsome young man’s figure flashed through her mind— he was the previous captain of the wind fleet, and had been a sergeant of the R.W.D. for two years, since the strikingly young age of twenty three. Aestas recalled how she and Shardow Gier used to come by the seashore just to watch the windriders from afar during their public practices. It was actually her first time coming face to face with the young windrider, on her sixteenth birthday, when she presented the badge to him.
	</p>
	<p class="p"><i>“You’re the little girl that used to come by the training sessions,”</i> he said to her when she pinned the shining badge on his chest— his velvety voice lowered so that only she could hear. Aestas looked up, startled. It didn’t occur to her that her face would be remembered by the young captain.
	</p>
	<p>She coughed and smiled, “keep it a secret for me?”
	</p>
	<p>He laughed out loud— the shouts and cheers around them almost drowned out his voice. 
	</p>
	<p>“<i>Oh—</i> sneaking out of the citadel often? I see?” he said, smiling a little as he gave his chin a little tilt, meaning that he got the message.
	</p>
	<p>He stepped beside her and bowed to the crowd before turning towards her and kneeling down. Aestas took the bundle from the concierge boy, and flung the cloth open and over the twenty five year old— the ivory cloak that was trimmed with green linings floated and landed perfectly around his broad shoulders and draped behind his back.
	</p>
	<p>“Esen Ventus,” Aestas said, loud and clear, her voice traveling through the grounds of the open square in the back of the main castle.
	</p>
	<p>“You are now second lieutenant of the Royal Windriders Department— servant to the Royal Army. You may now rise.”
	</p>
	<p>Cheers erupted throughout the castle grounds as Esen Ventus stood back up. The long ivory cloak— a color contrasting to his piercing black eyes, suited him just fine. His forehead, along with a pair of well balanced and dark eyebrows, was on display at the moment, due to his chestnut brown hair being combed up for the occasion.
	</p>
	<p>“I guess I’ll be meeting you more often in the future now, dear princess,” Esen Ventus laughed. The midnight-black eyes were gazing down at her— bold and confident. 
	</p>
	<p>“I guess you will,” Aestas smiled, looking away shyly, “Congratulations, Lieutenant Ventus.”
	</p>
	<p>The young lieutenant had glanced down at his new badge with a look of satisfaction.
	</p>
	<p>“ — may your future be smooth and bright,” the second heir of Hyacinth said, to which he smiled with ambition.
	</p>
	<p class="p">“Smooth and bright…” Aestas laughed bitterly at this moment, “that was such irony, now to think of it.”
	</p>
	<p>After Esen Ventus was made second lieutenant of the R.W.D., he was met with the first challenge of his career—the disaster of the Hyacinth’s first heir being abducted. How unfortunate was that…?
	</p>
	<p>Due to the multiple meetings and discussions with the R.A., Aestas did get to see the young Lieutenant much more often than they both imagined. Although they rarely had the time and opportunity to talk to each other directly, the young lieutenant still would greet her with a small salute with a wave of two gloved fingers, even if she were across the room. 
	</p>
	<p>Aestas often saw Esen Ventus deep in conversation with one of the second lieutenants of the Royal Swordsmen Department—Fae Baykartte— a tall girl with creamy ivory hair that was cut short in the front, but flowed long behind her back, and beneath Fae’s ivory bangs, were eyes of gradient grayish pink. The swordswoman looks much younger than her real age, and the people of the R.A. often mistook Baykartte as one of the trainees, despite her lieutenant attire. 
	</p>
	<p>Fae Baykartte had been made lieutenant two seasons ago (half a year ago), when Candentia was still here. It was, in fact, the first heir that pinned the badge on the ivory haired girl during the winter R.A. ceremony. The young swordswoman had just turned twenty six early that season.
	</p>
	<p>When Aestas first saw Fae Baykartte and Esen Ventus getting along peacefully, she was actually quite surprised, and relieved, for it was well known that the R.W.D and the R.S.D. were somewhat in a weird relationship— where they are companions, teammates, but also competitive rivals. And Esen Ventus, being the popular, talented, and successful young lieutenant, was the pride of the R.W.D., and the public enemy of the R.S.D., especially when he loved to toy with some of the other talented young members, such as Brontes Laers and Ivian Lena, to be specific.
	</p>
	<p>“ — Brontes Laers,” Aestas shook her head at the thought of the hot-tempered young swordsmen. She remembered Brontes Laers and Ivian Lena well, as the two went right to quarreling with each other, then with Esen Ventus, just after Aestas pinned the badges on all of them. Brontes Lears is a troublemaker… but regardless of his personality, he is extremely talented and also hard working— a fine candidate for the corporal position that opened this season under the urgent times. The matter is still under evaluation though— whether the twenty four year old would be made corporal…
	</p>
	<p class="p">It was when she came back to her senses that Aestas suddenly realized that the fog had been gradually lifted, the dampness of the air already dispersed, and she could see that the golden beams that descended from the mountain tops on the other side of Annyo were now dancing and prancing on the glittering surface of clear waters. The racing wind had also turned slightly to the side, and Aestas wondered if the wind was in a better mood, for in spite of the same icy cold temperature, the breeze that swirled through her soft ombre brown hair and blond highlights, was unbelievably soft as it was gentle.
	</p>
	<p>On the ships that sailed to and fro, people worked with upright spirits— even from standing in a small corner of the port, Aestas could feel the friendly and energetic atmosphere of the place. And on the streets and in the alleys, there were also flocks of people— letting out breaths of air that immediately got condensed and transformed into spheres of white smoke.
	</p>
	<p>The whole city seems to be gradually awakening, resembling a frozen city that had started to melt from the center and spreading warmth to the outermost lands, while the morning bells of the citadel signaled the start of a brand new day. The gear wheels of time and season have started to turn fast— it was time for Aestas to head back to the citadel. She took a final look at the shimmering waves and the boasterious harbor, tightened the strings of her long green cloak and ran uphill along the stone steps that led back to the terrace of Annyo city. 
	</p>
	<p>As Aestas ran along the shops that lined the sides of Pagiet Lane, she watched in awe as the wide lane gradually became bustling with noise. She couldn’t help but feel a sense of bizarreness— when all of Csettrecsran was still sleeping, the ports were already one step ahead, with their gear wheels of time turning; although it might be undetectable, a new day had already started, silently, within the fog.
	</p>
	<p>Aestas shivered— as expected, the mornings of Annyo were extremely cold. She adjusted her scarf slightly and glanced over her shoulders, down towards the seashores that were blurred by a thin mist. She smiled and ran along the hill, towards the citadel— it was as though she could still hear the clinging and clanging of the energetic bustle ringing in her ears. And although Candentia was still missing, Aestas felt like she could hear her sister’s husky but honeyed voice scolding her to run home.
	</p>
	<p class="p">The following days into the cold season were much harder than Aestas had expected. With piles of workload drowning her, she rarely had the time to sneak out of the citadel to see Shardow.
	</p>
	<p>Shardow—, Aestas sighed, she missed his ringing laughter and shining, forest green eyes. With winter entering the walls of the citadel, she often felt cold and lonely in her own home.
	</p>
	<p>Where was home? She often questions herself these days.
	</p>
	<p>Now that Candentia was said to <i>might</i> have disappeared <i>completely</i> from the surface of Cesttescran, and that Tsahn no longer was staying at the Nix, she often wandered through the palace grounds without feeling like she belonged. Even Aurelius, whom she adored, was absent from her life these days, and she wondered how he was holding up.
	</p>
	<p class="p">Aestas rubbed the foggy window with her shawl and looked outside. The first snow had started to fall in Annyo city. 
	</p>
	<p>Normally, it would have been the start of preparations for the annual festival of winter lights, when her older sister <i>should</i> be turning twenty one. This year, however, the citadel was as silent as can ever be. It was the Queen’s orders that the festival be held low-key with the sole purpose of praying for the lost princess to be well and alive— it has been almost two seasons since her older sister had been abducted. And one season has passed since word went out that she disappeared one day in autumn, along with the first son of Hellebore, who was said to be the abductor himself. 
	</p>
	<p>Aestas leaned her forehead on the window frame and watched the royal gardeners tend to the bushes that were starting to be covered in snow. 
	</p>
	<p>She heaved a heavy sigh— her warm breath causing the window to fog up. 
	</p>
	<p>Things were a mess at the center of Land Hyacinthous. And with the problems with the North deteriorating, it was a matter of time the two lands ended up in war.
	</p>
	<p>A season ago, the king of the North claimed that his son had been taken out by the Hyacinth heir— with a blade she hid under her underwear, and that they had her under custody in the dungeon after the tragedy. With no proof of evidence, the people of Land Hyacinthous accused them of the opposite— they said that the prince of Hellebore captured their heir and held her captive— and demanded the release of their princess. And despite the deterioration of their already-stinking relationship, no parties had made the first move so far. It wasn’t like they didn’t want to, but the truth was— they didn’t dare. 
	</p>
	<p>For the North, with the boundary enchantment still holding strong, they were like chickens in a cage, waiting to get slaughtered if they dare declare war. And for Hyacinthous, before ensuring that the first princess was safe and out of the hands of the North, they didn’t dare attack— in fear of Candentia’s life being on the line.
	</p>
	<p>Aestas left the window and strode down the hall. She was headed to her private office, which was on the fourth floor, in the north wing of the main castle— she had an office, along with her old bedroom, prepared for her at the main castle after Tsahn Aouthyerhl decided to join the winter program of R.A. new trainees. He had moved out of the Nix and into the dorms of the enchantment department several days ago. Aurelius Solicas— the general’s son, also stopped coming to the Nix after his big quarrel with Tsahn. Therefore, with all the people she cared about and that took care of her in the Nix gone, Aestas simply spent more and more time at the main castle grounds— there was a lot to do, anyways.
	</p>
	<p>She went into her office room and took out the key hidden under her dress. It was a silver key to a box she had a skilled and young R.A. enchantress made it for her in secret. She smiled when she thought of the friendly blonde— Trina Krelnein— her shop was one of the most daintiest places Aestas have ever been to, and she had immediately took a liking to the older when Candentia had took her down to the shop that stood on the edge of the terrace that overlooked the seashore. 
	</p>
	<p>Trina is like a cute looking older sister in Aestas’ opinion, and recently, whenever Aestas had new ideas for enchantments, she would run down to Trina’s shop and tell her all about it. The older would listen intently and draw out Aestas’ ideas on a piece of paper while sipping a cup of coffee. She was actually a lifesaver for Aestas— a torch in the dark, and a shelter in the storm.
	</p>
	<p>Upon turning the key and murmuring the spell, light swirled around her hands and the box opened. A letter was sitting peacefully inside, folded into the shape of a spade.
	</p>
	<p class="p">There has been a rumor going around that her sister— Candentia, and the young Hellebore heir— Lansher Hellebore, both left the North. It was said that they snuck out in the same way the young Hellebore heir did when he was younger, although this time was with the help of a few powerful black sorceresses. Aestas actually hoped that the rumor was true, for it meant that her sister might be out there, preparing to return anytime. But, still, after all— just as Aurelius Solicas kept on reminding her— a rumor is still a rumor. And despite the effort of the searching parties from both Lands, there was still no sign of either one of them anywhere, nor was a body found.
	</p>
	<p>“Could it be that they both died in the middle of a storm on the seas, and their bodies sunk to the very bottom?” some speculated, as it was almost impossible for such important people with such powers, to go undetected. There should have at least been a trace of magic left behind in the direction they headed.
	</p>
	<p class="p">“What’s your plan, Candentia?” Aestas murmured into the cold air, staring blankly at her large and empty office.
	</p>
	<p>She clutched the letter in her hand tightly. Esen Ventus— the second lieutenant of the R.W.D. had been reporting back to her since the start of their secret cooperation to send out undercover agents in search of the lost first heir. She knew that the rebellious and ambitious young lieutenant would eventually give in to her special request, and would be willing to conduct the operation. Persuading Esen Ventus might be one of her greatest achievements so far.
	</p>
	<div class="esenletter">
	<p><i>“We’ve finished searching the west region of the eastern lands and islands.”
	</i></p>
	<p>— his letter read.
	</p><br>
	<p><i>“There’s no trace of her magic there. I’m sorry.”
	</i></p></div>
	<p class="p">Aestas tore the letter into shreds absentmindedly, as she thought of the events of the afternoon. 
	</p>
	<p><i>“Four years of time,”</i> she muttered to herself, recalling the meeting she just attended. Different from the usual  R.A. meetings that were held in hidden war rooms of the main castle’s east wing, this particular one had been held in the diplomatic halls of the main castle’s south wing, and with the company of a few rare guests. Aestas shuddered, as the piercing violet eyes of a girl named Jashi— Jashi Hellebore, resurfaced in her mind. The girl is one of the older twin sisters of Lansher Hellebore, and had been granted the chance to travel from the North to Annyo for negotiation.
	</p>
	<p class="p">Aestas had been standing on the left side of the king, who sat in front of the large marble table in the grand hall of the south wing of the main castle— a space where the diplomatic activities of Land Hyacinthous usually take place. And Jashi Hellebore, who looked to be around the same age as her own older sister, had stood stoutly, facing them with her violet eyes glinting with confidence—
	</p>
	<p class="p"><b><i>“Our lord politely asks your majesty to remove the bounding enchantment,”</i></b> Jashi hellebore’s cold voice rang out through the hall.
	</p>
	<p class="p"><b>“Return the Hyacinth heir, and then will we consider your plea,”</b> the king had answered in his stern voice.
	</p>
	<p>“I’m afraid that the king of Hellebore could not simply comply with such shallow terms,” she said, “we would need an act of compromise from your side to make up for the loss of his son. And due to the fact that Candentia Hyacinth had shed Hellebore blood, it is only fair that she stayed in the North for further trials.”
	</p>
	<p>“If my daughter did kill your brother,” the king said, “we both know that it was an act of self-defense. So stop your nonsense and let us start working on practical terms.”
	</p>
	<p>Aestas shivered— Jashi’s calm smile and tilted head reminded her too much of a certain someone. 
	</p>
	<p>“Very well,” Jashi Hellebore said, “I like that, getting straight to the point.”
	</p>
	<p>“You make a move to attack the North. We kill your daughter,” the girl said, making every word loud and clear.
	</p>
	<p>The people in the hall gasped in horror at the young Hellebore’s words.
	</p>
	<p>“And if you hurt her, we’ll level the North to the ground,” the king said ever so calmly, “ — so we both don’t make a move. Boom,” he clasped his hands together, “back to the beginning.”
	</p>
	<p>Jashi seemed to sink into her thoughts for a second before looking up again.
	</p>
	<p>“The easiest way for this to end is to remove the enchantment your Father set upon our land,” she said, “why can’t you comply with such a simple term?”
	</p>
	<p>Jashi Hellebore looked around the room, her violet eyes scanning every face in the process. 
	</p>
	<p>“One may come to think that the powers of your lands have weakened so— that the enchanters now are no match compared with those serving the last generation. <i>Is that true? Your highness?</i>”
	</p>
	<p>She drew the last words ever so sweetly.
	</p>
	<p>There was silence in the halls. 
	</p>
	<p>Aestas glanced sideways at her father, hoping to make out a reaction. And to her surprise, she saw a glint of something she often saw when she and her father solved puzzles together— it was the same glint he always had when he found a solution to the problem.
	</p>
	<p>The second heir was right with her instincts, as after a while, the king spoke again— this time with full confidence.
	</p>
	<p>“To be honest with you,” he said, “we <i>should</i> be able to remove the enchantment.”
	</p>
	<p>Waves of astonished gasps spread out through the hall.
	</p>
	<p>“But only under one condition,” he emphasized.
	</p>
	<p>Jashi Hellebore tilted her head with sheer curiosity— “I hope that it is clear between us that Candentia Hyacinth <i>stayed</i> in the north,” she said, “<b><i>that</i></b>— we <b><i>cannot</i></b> compromise.” 
	</p>
	<p>The King nodded.
	</p>
	<p>“Your request is clear and well received, and we comply,” he said, grabbing the queen back into her seat as she jumped up— her face red.
	</p>
	<p>The king coughed and continued— “Candentia Hyacinth is to remain in the north and would face your trials. And as long as she is kept alive, we will continue to work on lifting the spell with your help in providing certain materials.”
	</p>
	<p>“Certain materials you say?” Jashi asked, though she already guessed what the king meant.
	</p>
	<p>And with no surprise— <b><i>“northern crystals—”</i></b> was what he said.
	</p>
	<p>“The enchantment spell was cast with Northern crystals,” he explained, “and we would need the same crystals to break the spell. If we had our own, there would be no problem. But the thing is that— you know—?” 
	</p>
	<p>The king rested his chin on his wrist as he leant forward, looking Jashi in the eye— 
	</p>
	<p>“All of our crystals went dim the night the bounding enchantment around your land was finished, without us knowing the reason. However, we will not blame our power shortage on you and will do as you wish as long as your land provides us with the crystals we need to power up the magic of our enchanters.”
	</p>
	<p>“Very well,” the young Hellebore said, “consider it done.”
	</p>
	<p>The king lifted one eyebrow.
	</p>
	<p>“Oh—? Are you in charge of the crystals? Forgive me for mistaking you as a child.”
	</p>
	<p>“Regrettably, I’m not the one in charge,” Jashi replied, “but as young as I look, I am capable of doing many things,” she smirked, “and that includes persuading my Father to make the right decision.”
	</p>
	<p>“How long will you need?” she asked, “to break down the spell, I mean.”
	</p>
	<p>“Due to the reality of the weakened power of enchanters in this generation…” the king said thoughtfully, “we might need twice as much time as it took to create the spell…”
	</p>
	<p>“So— <b><i>eight</i></b> years.”
	</p>
	<p>Jashi drew in a sharp breath.
	</p>
	<p>“I’m afraid we can’t wait that long. And besides,” she peered at the king in a look of curiosity, “do you really think that your daughter could last eight years in the North?”
	</p>
	<p>“Oh, I reckon she would be just fine there,” he said with a wave of the hand.
	</p>
	<p><i>“That’s actually true. She can literally strive anywhere,”</i> Aestas thought.
	</p>
	<p>The king continued— “And as she is born of winter and ice, she might actually take a liking to your homeland.”
	</p>
	<p>“What I meant was— for her to be kept away from home for—” Jashi stopped and laughed.
	</p>
	<p>“..nevermind…,” she drawled, “the thing is— the most we can wait is <b><i>two</i></b> years.”
	</p>
	<p>The king narrowed his green eyes— 
	</p>
	<p><b>“Six.”</b>
	</p>
	<p>“Do you really not want to see your oldest daughter’s face for such a long time?”
	</p>
	<p>The king glanced at his wife, who was now glaring at him with fierce eyes— he had to be careful, <b>“five,</b>> he compromised.
	</p>
	<p><b>“Three,”</b> Jashi stood her ground.
	</p>
	<p><b>“Four,”</b> the king wasn’t backing down either.
	</p>
	<p>“Fine,” Jashi agreed as she stepped forward, <b>“four years of time.”</b>
	</p>
	<p><b>“Four years of time,”</b> the king echoed as he grasped Jashi’s extended hand and gave it a firm shake.
	</p>
	<p>“And you provide us with crystal,” he added.
	</p>
	<p>Jashi Hellebore nodded— “yes, your majesty.”
	</p>
	<p class="p"><b>“And no harm could be done to Candentia!”</b> a voice echoed loudly as Jashi turned to exit the hall. She looked back over her shoulder without turning around. The second princess looked as if she wanted to flee the scene already; the king was looking at his wife, clearly troubled, and trying to hold back the queen from charging at Jashi— It was she who had called after the Hellebore girl.
	</p>
	<p><i>“No harm could be done to her, do you hear me?”</i> she repeated. And though her voice was calm, it was also full of anger.
	</p>
	<p>“Why— <i>of course,</i>” Jashi said, “we will take good care of her,” and she smiled before adding, “as long as she is in the realms of the North.” 
	</p>
	<p class="p"><i>So is she still in the North? </i>
	</p>
	<p><i>— Yes, it seems as if she was.</i>
	</p>
	<p><i>— No, it seemed like she wasn’t.</i>
	</p>
	<p>It was like rolling the dice— no prediction could possibly be made.
	</p>
	<div class="esenletter">
		<p><i>“No trace of magic in the south region of the eastern lands and islands either.” 
		</i></p>
		<p>—another letter read. 
	</p></div>
	<p>Aestas tore the paper in half and set the pieces on fire.
	</p>
	<p class="pend">“So… are you alive? And where on Csettrecsran are you? If not dead.” Aestas sighed as she watched Esen Ventus’ neat and clean handwriting burn up in the flames. 
	</p>
