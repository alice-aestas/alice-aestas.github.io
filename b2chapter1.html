	<h2 class="chapter title">The West</h2>
<div class="chaptercontent">
	<p><b class="b">T</b>sahn hummed happily as he leaned over the railing of the upper deck. The large sails above flapped occasionally against the so breeze as the vessel gilded steadily across the clear waters. The curves above the horizon seemed to be much larger than they were at dawn, which meant that it was certain that they were sailing towards land, and that the voyage across the south-west-seas was finally coming near its end. 
	</p>
	<p> Over a week ago, Aurelius and Tsahn agreed that their original plan to search the whole Southern land had to be put on halt and have then decided that it was time for them to continue overseas, towards the western lands. 
	</p>
	<p>They had been travelling together for approximately a year, ever since they ran into each other on the way up the mountains south of Syarchia. Tsahn had followed Aurelius towards the direction of the west, down to the open grasslands. Aurelius had searched the lands alone for a year, and another, aer he teamed up with Tsahn. 
	</p>
	<p>With no traces of Candentia found in the middle west of the southern lands, they headed their way towards the northwest shores of the continent, where the density of western merchant ships is the highest. 
	</p>
	<p>It would be easier to find a ship willing to take them in. 
	</p>
	<p>Aer two days of searching for a ride to hitchhike overseas, they managed to persuade one of the captains of a medium-sized merchant ship to take them under his wing. He told them in his loud and cheerful voice that they are welcome abroad, as long as they worked hard along with the crew. 
	</p>
	<p>It hadn’t been too bad, much to Tsahn’s surprise and relief. In fact, the sail actually turned out to be quite smooth and enjoyable.
	</p>
	<p>The only hard work they really had to do was load heavy cargo on and off the ship in the beginning and at the end. Other than that, due to the favorable weather, they didn’t have much to worry about on board and spent a rather large amount of time roaming the decks, observing the shimmering waves, and chatting away with the members of the crew. And with the most perfect south-east wind to their aid, the outline of the distant mountains in the west appeared on the fih day since the ship le the banks of the southern lands, making the journey at least three days faster than the average record.
	</p>
	<p>Tsahn let out a gasp of delight as the ship swerved swily around the steep edge where the large chunk of grayish green plunged into the deep blue seas, revealing a bay flocked with numerous white sails. They had passed the barrier of the extending wall of small mountains that lined the south-west coastline and were officially in the realms of the far west. Colorful villages situated at the foot of the green hills soon came into view as they glided towards the harbor.
	</p>
	<p>“Aurie!” Tsahn called down to the main deck, his voice full of excitement.
	</p>
	<p>“Your friend is calling you from up there,” a young looking lad named Kune said. His skin was tan and his face was sprinkled with freckles. He was the youngest member on the ship, having just turned seventeen.
	</p>
	<p>“I know,” Aurelius simply replied as he continued to tighten the ropes around the several wooden cargo boxes he and Kune had just carried up from the hold below.
	</p>
	<p>The young freckled boy wiped the sweat off of his forehead with the back of his hand and glanced at Aurelius.
	</p>
	<p>The raven-haired boy had his outer layer of clothing tied around his waist, and the sleeves of the inner layer rolled up, which le his upper limbs bare with only the hands being covered by a pair of fingerless gloves.
	</p>
	<p>Kune watched Aurelius work his way around the boxes, looping the ropes skillfully. The tall lad placed his left foot on one of the boxes, holding it in place, and tugged on the other end of the rope, and soon, with a swi movement of his hands, a firm knot was done.
	</p>
	<p>“It looks as if you’ve done this all your life,” Kune half joked, as he came over to examine the knot.
	</p>
	<p>Aurelius rested his arm on his knee and opened his mouth to thank the other for the compliment, but was soon interrupted by another call. “Aurie. Aurelius!”
	</p>
	<p>Both Kune and Aurelius looked up to see Tsahn’s head pop out from under the edge of the ceiling. He had walked a few steps down the stairs and bent down to see if Aurelius was there. 
	</p>
	<p>“Are you busy?” he asked aer seeing the cargo. “Do you guys need help?” 
	</p>
	<p>“Nah, everything’s set here in the meantime,” Aurelius said, putting his foot back down on the floor, “how are things going on up there in the upper deck? Do you guys need help?”
	</p>
	<p>“We finished the work up there a while ago,” said Tsahn as he squatted down, folding his arms on his knees. Unlike Aurelius, who preferred fingerless gloves, Tsahn had straps of cloth wrapped around his palms. It was a habit he picked up from his homeland. 
	</p>
	<p>“Then what were you calling me for earlier?” questioned Aurelius. “So you heard,” Tsahn raised his eyebrows, <i>“and you didn’t come running?”</i>
	</p>
	<p>“Oh, stop the drama,” Aurelius let out a so laugh before asking, “what is it?”
	</p>
	<p>“Come on up,” Tsahn said, excited again, “the sight’s worth seeing,” and before running back up, he stopped and added, this time talking to the boy next to Aurelius, “Kune, I believe in your strength. Drag him up, will you?”
	</p>
	<p>“...what?” Kune blinked.
	</p>
	<p>“Don’t mind him,” Aurelius said as he stretched his back and arms, “come on, let’s go see what he’s so excited about.” 
	</p>
	<p class="p">The reefs of the sails have already been taken in when they arrived at the upper deck.
	</p>
	<p>Aurelius let out a low whistle as he approached the spot beside Tsahn, who had been leaning backwards on the railing of the upper deck, waiting.
	</p>
	<p>“It’s pretty nice, isn’t it?” Tsahn asked, as he turned around and leaned over the side of the ship, mimicking Aurelius’s posture, both elbows resting on the railings.
	</p>
	<p>Aurelius hummed in agreement. 
	</p>
	<p>Unlike the steep mountains that stood behind the ord of land Hyacinthous, and great prairies that extended far into the land from the shores of the southern lands, the landscape before his eyes was of one he had never seen before.
	</p>
	<p>With higher ashy green mountains on each side, clear blue water at the bottom, and colorful villages situated on the rather large terrains at the foot of small green mountains, the sight gave the bizarre image of a jade bowl broken in half, drenched with multiple layers of pigment, containing gems stones of different colors.
	</p>
	<p>Aurelius’ dark lashes fluttered shut as a few drops of water splashed up from the surface and onto his face. <i>The temperature of the water was freezing cold.</i>
	</p>
	<p>Beside him, Tsahn chuckled. 
	</p>
	<p>Something tugged in Aurelius’ chest as he gazed silently at the broken jade bowl, which was growing larger and larger as they steered towards its center. And he let a wave of memory take over his mind.
	</p><br>
	<p class="p">“If you could only choose one place to visit before you die, Aurelius,” Candentia had once said to him when they were studying the maps of planet Csettrecsran in the royal library, about four years ago.
	</p>
	<p>He remembered how his heart rate sped up slightly when she tilted her head to meet his eyes.
	</p>
	<p>“One place only,” she said, keeping her voice quiet, as they were supposed to do in the library, “where would it be?”
	</p>
	<p>Aurelius thought for a moment.
	</p>
	<p>“That is a difficult question,” he answered slowly aer a while, holding his gaze, “I’ll have to think carefully about it.”
	</p>
	<p>“I was just curious,” Candentia sat down and rested her head and arms on the table, her loose curls draped behind her back. Aurelius sat down beside her and looked down at the ash black head. He leaned sideways and rested his cheek on his fist . “You’re not planning on running away, are you?” he chuckled soly.
	</p>
	<p>She turned and looked at him with playful disdain. 
	</p>
	<p>“As if I could outrun you and Tsahn,” she said, “I feel like the two of you can smell my blood from miles away.”
	</p>
	<p>He raised up his left eyebrow, “we might help you, you know?” “And have your faces drawn on walls with the word ‘wanted’ underneath?” she said, mimicking his facial expressions. He reached over and blocked her vision with his open palm. Her mouth opened slightly and closed again in confusion. He stared. “...” 
	</p>
	<p>“...Aurelius?”
	</p>
	<p>“Where do you choose?” he asked, changing back to the subject as he retreated his hand, revealing a pair of deep gray eyes. The sides of her plum lips curved up into a mischievous smile, “there’s actually two places,” she said.
	</p>
	<p>“Two?” he raised his eyebrow again, “I thought you were the one who said we could only choose one.”
	</p>
	<p>She sat up calmly and flicked his forehead.
	</p>
	<p>His eyelids squeezed shut and opened up again with a look of disapproval.
	</p>
	<p>“Stop giving me that skeptical look,” she laughed soly, “it’s actually a miracle that I narrowed my choices down to only two.” “That’s actually true. So which two?” he asked, rubbing his forehead. 
	</p>
	<p>“Well,” she said, “the first one’s not actually open for visiting. But if the boundary spell were to be broken, and we were to make peace someday, I would want to see the northern lights. I heard that they used to have the most splendid winter festivals.” 
	</p>
	<p><i>“The North?”</i> he asked, skeptical again, <i>“really?”</i>
	</p>
	<p>With a flick of the fingers, she sent the glass pen that was previously lying peacefully on the map spinning. Colorful lights twirled as the pen spun wildly.
	</p>
	<p>“Yup,” she said simply, “the North.”
	</p>
	<p>The pen started to slow down its spinning and gradually came to a stop.
	</p>
	<p>“What’s the other one?” Aurelius asked as he gave the pen another flick.
	</p>
	<p>Candentia’s eyes sparkled, her clear gray orbs reflecting the spinning light. She sat up straight and leaned his way, reaching for the le part of the map, and pointed out her answer. 
	</p><br>
	<p class="p">Aurelius was soon pulled back into reality as another wave of cold sea water splashed up and sprinkled on his face.
	</p>
	<p>“The West,” Aurelius murmured as he stared at the passing scenery in front of him and wiped the drops of water away. 
	</p>
	<p class="p"><i>If only Candentia were here with them. </i>
	</p>
	<p class="p">“We<i> will</i> find her,” Tsahn said, reading his mind.
	</p>
	<p>Aurelius let out a pained laugh as he buried his face in his palms.
	</p>
	<p>“She better be alive,” he said, voice muffled.
	</p>
	<p>“We have to believe that she is. And I <i>do</i> believe that she is,” Tsahn said soly as he wrapped a hand around Aurelius’s wrist, trying to comfort him.
	</p>
	<p>“Geez,” Aurelius looked up abruptly at the sudden touch and grabbed the hand on his wrist.
	</p>
	<p>Tsahn looked confused.
	</p>
	<p>“Your hand,” Aurelius pointed out, “is freezing cold.” He looked at Tsahn, who had on a similar outfit as he did, except that the inner and outer layers of the clothin’ were both missing. “Eh,” Tsahn said sheepishly as he tried to pull his hand away, “I didn’t realize that,” and he sneezed. 
	</p>
	<p>“Short sleeves, <i>really?”</i>
	</p>
	<p>Aurelius let go of Tsahn and crossed his own arms, eyeing the other up and down. 
	</p>
	<p>“Where are all your other clothes? Did you burn them already? Or did someone steal them?”
	</p>
	<p>“Tsk, tsk. And I thought I was the nagging one,” a tiny smile slipped past Tsahn’s lips as he shook his head, his ashy blond hair swaying as he did. 
	</p>
	<p>Aurelius raised his left eyebrow. 
	</p>
	<p>“Stop giving me that skeptical look,” Tsahn said as he reached out his hand and gave his friend’s forehead a flick.
	</p>
	<p>Aurelius’ eyes merely squeezed shut for a split second and opened with a look that said, <i>“seriously?”</i>
	</p>
	<p>“It had gotten too hot when I was doing the work up here and I took the two layers off and stashed them back in the crew’s quarter,” Tsahn explained, “and be glad I still have <i>something</i> on.” 
	</p>
	<p>“And by the way, you sound like Cadenty,” he laughed. “Oh, shut up,” Aurelius said.
	</p>
	<p>He tossed over the clothing that had been tied on his waist. “Put this on. It’s still early spring for fucks sake.”
	</p>
	<p>“...thanks,” Tsahn didn’t dare protest, and besides, he was actually freezing to death, “roll your inner sleeves down, though,” he added, eyeing Aurelius, “we both know you ain’t that strong against the cold.”
	</p>
	<p><i>“It’s still early spring for fucks sake,”</i> he said under his breath, mimicking Aurelius’ tone, which earned him a hard slap on the back. Kune, being beside them all this time, couldn’t find the right timing to cut in. He wanted to ask about this girl that kept coming up in their conversations. She sounded like a family member of theirs. “But Aurelius and Tsahn aren’t actually siblings though, are they?” Kune thought to himself, “apart from them both being quiet and good looking, they look and talk nothing alike.” 
	</p>
	<p class="p">Following behind them and listening to their quiet conversations, he came to think of how much he would miss this particular duo. He had grown immensely fond of the pair during the course of their time spent on the ship. Having started a career on the ship at the young age of fourteen, he rarely had the time and opportunities to play with friends his age. Most of the members of the crew are above thirty, which leaves a huge age gap between his colleagues and him. There was a small group of four younger members that oen included him in their activities, and although they pampered him, he sometimes wished that they wouldn’t treat him as a little kid.
	</p>
	<p>The two mysterious lads who suddenly appeared and were announced to be joining them temporarily about a week ago, introduced themselves as twenty two year olds. Kune secretly thought they looked at least three years younger than they claimed to be. Although they did seem a little older than he was, they talked to him in a way he wished his other colleagues would. 
	</p>
	<p>Quiet and cold as the two strangers seemed to be, they were actually quite friendly when they spoke to him, and there was always a certain playfulness in their conversations that made Kune feel as if he had already known them for a long time. 
	</p>
	<p class="p">Kune was lost in thoughts when he felt an arm drape around his shoulders and cold fingers pinching his cheeks. He looked up and saw two pairs of curious eyes, orange amber and yellow hazel, peering at him.
	</p>
	<p>“Whatcha thinking?” Tsahn asked as he gave Kune's shoulders a little shake, “you sad that we're parting?”
	</p>
	<p>“...” Kune didn't know what to say, and blurted out instead, “your hands are cold.”
	</p>
	<p>“...” 
	</p>
	<p>“How I told you so,” Aurelius let out as he started to laugh. The lips curled upwards as his amber eyes sparkled with laughter. And Kune couldn’t help but stare at the rare sight.
	</p>
	<p>“What,” Aurelius said, as he ran his slim fingers through the raven black strands and pushed back his hair that a gust of wind blew over his eyes, his smile turning into a puzzled gaze, “are you two staring at me for?”
	</p>
	<p>“He has a weird sense of humor,” Tsahn said to Kune. 
	</p>
	<p>“Lucky lads,” the captain said loudly beside them, snapping them back to their surroundings.
	</p>
	<p>“You two boys sure are lucky. Them weathers have been real nice these days. Perfect wind making it one of the shortest trips I sailed,” he rambled on, “the longest one I had through them waters was <b><i>nineteen days!</i></b>” his loud voice boomed in the end, which made Tsahn jump slightly. Kune patted him. It looks like Tsahn never got used to the captain's loud bursts.
	</p>
	<p><b><i>“Nineteen!</i></b> the captain said with a sudden slap on Aurelius' back. Poor boy. He almost toppled over.
	</p>
	<p>Tsahn mocked his friend silently.
	</p>
	<p>“Can you imagine?!” the captain was saying.
	</p>
	<p>No, they could <b><i>not</i> </b>imagine. 
	</p>
	<p>Both of the boys could toss a skill or two when it came to riding the seawind, for they have had some practice, but they sure weren't experienced sailors. 
	</p>
	<p>Back then, during the summers, they oen went down to the shores beneath Annyo with Candentia, and the three would go out on small sailboats from time to time, with the help of one of the previous fleet captains, Esen Ventus. Although it was considered a challenging activity, it was nothing compared to long voyages over the vast seas. 
	</p>
	<p>Tsahn shuddered merely at the thought of being stuck on seas during a storm and started naming all the spirits he could remember, and thanked them for their blessings. In his opinion, drowning could be one of the worst ways to die. 
	</p>
	<p><b><i>“Furl the sails and be prepared to drop the anchor!”</i> </b>the captain bellowed. 
	</p>
	<p>And with a loud grunt, he turned the heavy wheel and steered the ship into the port.
	</p>
	<p>The harbor, in which they sank the anchor, belongs to a town called Kantenti. The town is nothing like any other places they had seen throughout their journey so far, and Aurelius can still vividly recall how the salty taste of the air gradually turned into a mixture of wood, smoke and honey as he stepped onto land. 
	</p>
	<p>Aer setting everything in place, the crew headed into the town for supplies.
	</p>
	<p>Aurelius gazed up in wonder as they walked through the alley. Sheer sheets of radiant colors hung from windows and balconies, flowing ever so gracefully as if time had been slowed down. The buildings, with tones of ashy gray and brick red, seem to be made of clay and stone, most of which are two-storied. A puff of grayish red flew and dispersed into the cold air as Aurelius blew the clay dust off of his fingers. He had been tracing the cool walls unconsciously with his le hand.
	</p>
	<p>And against the constant buzz of the busy chatter in the markets, the overlapping of multiple tunes made their way into Aurelius' ears. Different from the fresh smell of flowers his hometown had, the air of the town flowed of incense and perfume.
	</p>
	<p>The bizarreness and alluring air of the Western land made it feel like walking in a dream, and Aurelius thought about how Candentia would love the place if she were here. Town Kantenti— even the name of the place reminded him of her. 
	</p>
	<p>Due to the good weather, the ports would be busier than usual, and there was a three-day-limit set for all the merchant ships. The captain was kind enough to let Tsahn and Aurelius stay on his boat in the meantime in exchange for their help with the cargo and merchandise. The young boys were ever so grateful.
	</p>
	<p>The problem with traveling undercover while under secret and private orders, was that communication is considered a one-way act. If it was urgent and necessary, they could send letters back to the Annyo, but for Esen Ventus or Aestas Hyacinth to contact them was out of the question, as there was no subtle way for it to be done. Besides, never once in their letters did they dare write down where they were staying, in fear of the letter getting intercepted and them being hunted down. In conclusion, with no way for Aestas and Esen to send them funds, not only do they have to search for food and shelter on their own, they also have to find ways to earn the money and cover for their own expenses. This applies to every new location— every time. 
	</p>
	<p>Aer a few hours of observing and analyzing, both Tsahn and Aurelius thought that the town of Kantenti could be the perfect place for a temporary base-camp. It had the prosperity to keep a large number of people alive, and the bustling diversity to make it easier for them to blend in.
	</p>
	<p class="p">It was the last night before the crew was to leave for another town along the coast up north, and Tsahn and Aurelius tagged along with them for a “farewell gathering.” They all felt a little down, especially Kune, who was extremely reluctant to part with the two friends he had grown so fond of.
	</p>
	<p>The place they have come to, is one of the busiest and brightest places in Kantenti during the night— “The Tricheri,” as people call it, is a seven-story restaurant that serves the most authentic western dishes during the day, and famous western drinks and wines at night.
	</p>
	<p>The food, though devine, is not what the matriarch of the Tricheri is the most proud of, for the main attraction at the place is the brilliance of their crew of musicians and dancers. Every evening, when lanterns lit up the sky, no matter if it rained or shined, you could hear the crisp sound of tiny silver bells tied on dancers’ legs ring as the captivating performers took to the floors of the Tricheri. And soon aer, the low beats of the drums would roll out, signaling the start of another breathless night.
	</p>
	<p>In the building, there were groups of people enjoying their meals and drinks as the musicians played on. Some dancers twirled gracefully on the stage as the others, who weren't performing, chatted up with the customers.
	</p>
	<p>“Bottoms up!” the captain boomed. 
	</p>
	<p>“Ay, ay!” the crew cheered.
	</p>
	<p>They all raised their mugs and chugged down the bubbling drinks. Tsahn coughed and wiped his mouth with the back of his hand as his eyes watered up due to the strong taste of the western wine. Aurelius, who sat beside him, did the same. There wasn’t too much time for them to hesitate because soon enough, their mugs were filled up to the brim and shoved back into their hands as the captain raised his own in their direction.
	</p>
	<p>“Here’s to the lads we picked up on the other side of the seas!” he shouted above the loud bustling noise and music. 
	</p>
	<p>“Ay, ay!” the crew cheered. 
	</p>
	<p>“Here’s to you! Dear friends, who brought with them good weather and wind. May you find what you are searching for!” he roared, “and may you have fair winds and following seas!”
	</p>
	<p class="pend"> “Fair winds and following seas!” the crew echoed.
