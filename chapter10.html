	<h2 class="chapter title">The Young Hawk Far From Home</h2>

<div class="chaptercontent">
	<p><b class="b">“I</b>s this seat taken?” a sweet voice sounded. A small group of girls, about three to five people, hid behind the tall brunette that spoke boldly.
	</p>
	<p>“No, no,” the ivory-haired boy she spoke to looked up and shook his head hastily. “Please take a seat,” he gestured.
	</p>
	<p>“Hey, Ernise,” he waved, having spotted the cute blonde that sat down beside the brunette, who blushed and waved back.
	</p>
	<p>“Candor,” Ernise greeted, voice shy.
	</p>
	<p>“Oh? you two know each other?” the brunette mused, “you won’t mind changing seats with me then?” she winked at her friend, who hid her face behind the short curls, blushing. “I actually wanted to sit near the middle for a better view; because of my eye condition,” the brunette said to Candor, gesturing at her own eyes, which sparkled in the shade of emerald green.
	</p>
	<p>A cold snort sounded behind and above. “Nice one—” a tall girl muttered as she sat down, a row behind them. Magnificent hair flowed to her waist, in a curtain of pink blonde with plum-colored highlights. She had originally aimed for a seat one row ahead, near the raven-head boy, who seemed unbothered by the commotion; where the brunette and the other girls had beaten her to. And although the two girls never spoke with each other before, one of them already knew the other’s name.
	</p>
	<p>“Rosaline Everbear, is it?” the brunette said stiffly, “you got a problem?”
	</p>
	<p>“No,” the girl, Rosaline, snorted, not at all surprised that her name was known by the stranger— she was popular and famous, so as she thought, after all.
	</p>
	<p> “You go ahead and take the seat,” Rosaline smirked, “but you should know that your intentions are spilling all over the place.” Her sangria-colored orbs rimmed with a lilac glow, full of hostility, as she glanced from the brunette to the left, where the raven-head sat.
	</p>
	<p>The brunette shifted uneasily under the cold gaze, and said nothing. 
	</p>
	<p>The quiet lad, who had sat there calmly, not once turning back during the conflict, suddenly stood up, startling the two. He gestured to the brunette. “Sit here,” he said simply, unfazed by the glances casted at him.
	</p>
	<p>“What? I don’t— It’s—” the brunette sputtered, blushing violently when the general’s son’s gaze landed upon her.
	</p>
	<p>“You needed to sit near the center, right?” Aurelius Solicas’s tone was gentle, which caught the brunette, and Rosaline, by surprise. “Switch with me,” he said, with a tilt of his chin, “I don’t mind.”
	</p>
	<p>Rosaline fummed with annoyance as the brunette casted her a sidelong glance as she moved her books, face smug.
	</p>
	<p>“I hope you don’t mind <i>me</i> sitting in front of you,” Aurelius then turned to Rosaline, who blinked rapidly, trying to process the fact that the boy <i>initiated</i> a talk with her.
	</p>
	<p>“No, <i>of course not,</i>” she flushed, her heart racing when the boy pulled his lips into a small smile. He gave her a slight nod before sitting back down.
	</p>
	<p>“You popular bastard,” Aurelius’ friend, who was seated beside him once again, whispered, “even the queen bees are all over you.”
	</p>
	<p>“Snap that illusion out of your mind, Candor,” Aurelius replied with a short laugh, “there’s no such thing.”
	</p>
	<p>“You don’t know what you’re talking about,” Candor muttered, “they’re so clearly into you.”
	</p>
	<p class="p">It was hard for Rosaline to focus during class, as one beautiful distraction sat just in front of her eyes. He was so close— leaning back in his chair— and she had to resist the urge of reaching out a hand, to comb down the small, cute, loose hair that popped out from the other well-behaved, silky strands of black. 
	</p>
	<p>Midway through class, she noticed how Aurelius Solicas visibly stiffened when Tsahn Aouthyerhl’s name was called out by Kye Anek, who had volunteered to become one of the subjects for the demonstration of the dream-extracting enchantment.
	</p>
	<p>“You seem tense. Are you alright?” the brunette, Heather, asked Aurelius. Rosaline had overheard the girl’s name when she introduced herself, boldly, to the amber-eyed lad. Heather Yoilder, is her full name; a Hyacinthousian, and was born of autumn, the same as Aurelius; graduated from another academy— the Northwest Academy, different from the one Aurelius, Candor and Rosaline all attended.
	</p>
	<p>Rosaline bit down on the tip of her pen, hard, when Heather, the brunette, inched closer to Aurelius, her arm nearly touching his. With Candentia Hyacinth out of the picture, Rosaline thought this to be her best chance at shooting her shot with the golden boy; the pretty brunette from the other academy better watch out, if they were going after the same prey. 
	</p>
	<p>Upon Heather’s concern, the boy shook his head slightly, “nothing to worry about,” he murmured, and leaned forward, chin resting on his palm, creating some distance between the girl and himself. Rosaline smirked privately, satisfied.
	</p>
	<p class="p">“What happened to you two?” Candor asked under his breath, noticing how Tsahn Aouthyerhl glanced their way for a moment. 
	</p>
	<p>“Did you two have a fight or something?”
	</p>
	<p>“Nothing,” Aurelius replied darkly, his gaze never leaving the honey-brown head that stood in the front of the classroom; played absentmindedly with the thin, black string around his neck. Heather, stealing a glance at the graceful fingers, gulped involuntarily.
	</p>
	<p>“There’s obviously <i>something</i> going on,” Candor muttered, “‘nothing,’ my ass. The two of you never even exchanged one word since the start of the winter program.”
	</p>
	<p>“You sure are invested in my social life, Candor,” Aurelius chuckled softly.
	</p>
	<p>“I’m just being the good friend that I am,” Candor huffed, “are you sure you don’t want to get it off your chest?”
	</p>
	<p>Aurelius shrugged and leaned back in silence, his amber eyes reflecting the light that lit up from the platform, where dream fragments soared; the smooth outline of his side profile glowed, when the warm, golden light hit his face; while the shadows of his lashes and strands of hair danced on his cheeks, lips and chin. 
	</p>
	<p>“Fine,” Candor huffed, “ignore me. Ignore you dear friend.” 
	</p>
	<p>On Aurelius’ left, Heather Yoilder fidgeted, heart thumping so loud she feared that the others would hear. She was starting to regret her choice of coming up to the boys and asking to exchange seats. 
	</p>
	<p>“It’s for Ernise,” she encouraged herself, “to help my new friend so that she could talk to that Candor boy.” But the thought crumbled on the spot, almost instantly, at the mere glance of the boy next to her. Who was she kidding? Rosaline, the dumb bitch behind them, was right— her intentions were spilling all over the place. She wiped her sweaty palms on her short, pleated skirt and pinched her thigh. 
	</p>
	<p>“Get a grip of yourself, Heather,” she murmured to herself. It wasn’t normal for her to become such a nervous wreck around anyone— even back at the Northwest academy of Kanterra, Heather had always been confident and outgoing; popular among her fellow schoolmates. Perhaps it was the different atmosphere that separated the citadel from the more common grounds; or the nerves of training amongst the most talented people she had met; or simply because it was the one and only, <i>Aurelius Solicas </i>, that she was trying to initiate a conversation with. 
	</p>
	<p>Not to exaggerate, but the boy could be counted as a nobel idol for a fair number of his peers: being the first son of the royal swordsmen department’s incumbent general, he didn’t disappoint in either enchantment and combat performances, nor his appearances. And despite the distance he held with most people, the twenty one year old had somehow been the main attraction wherever he went. 
	</p>
	<p>The dark gaze and cold demeanor of the golden boy made Heather’s desire to break past his boundaries grow, and she was determined to get to know him, even when there are some other girls breathing down her neck in competition, girls such as Rosaline Everbear. 
	</p>
	<p>Rosaline had attended the First Academy of Kanterra, which was the one Aurelius enrolled in, and Heather had heard stories of both individuals when the schools held tournaments together— “The rose full of thorns,” was the nickname for Rosaline among their peers, and “the golden boy— Aurelius,” was what they called the general’s son— both brilliant students known for not only the looks, but also the skills; they sat just in front and behind one another in this very classroom, and just beside Heather.
	</p>
	<p>Heather caught her mind drifting off and shook her head to steer clear of the spiraling thoughts, rejoining the class. And to her amazement, she saw that the scene, where Tsahn Aouthyerhl’s dream took place, is of a land where most of the students had never been before. 
	</p>
	<p>Kye Anek, remembering the drawings and pictures that his parents had shown him, far too well, recognized the broad grasslands, tall trees, and high mountains. It was the southern lands. And not only were the students looking at the green land, they were soaring in cool blue and misty white, through the eyes of a hawk or eagle; the green and brown treetops of the realms of the clan Syarchia loomed from underneath. 
	</p>
	<p>The students watched in awe as the bird of prey soared higher into the sky, above the clouds, as the gust of strong wind took them from under their wide-stretched wings. On the sea of pure white about thirty feet below, five tiny shadows of the birds could be seen casted upon, accompanied by five larger ones that danced and zoomed around.
	</p>
	<p>“Tsahn!” a young girl called, “is that all that you got?” she laughed happily as she dived over the others. 
	</p>
	<p>Rosaline jerked her head up at the voice— although the girl looked much younger, at the age about sixteen, or seventeen, the ashy black locks and gray eyes were hard to miss. It was Candentia Hyacinth, the first heir of their land, that was gliding among four other young teenagers, high in the air, with their leather capes spread out by their arms.
	</p>
	<p>“Slow down!” a young boy, whom the class recognized to be a slightly younger version of the sleeping lad on stage, called, laughing also, “we promised my father that we would be careful.” 
	</p>
	<p><i>“Weeee—”</i> another girl, her yellow and brown hazel eyes giving away her heritage of a southerner, cried joyously as she spun like an arrow and shot ahead of the group, ignoring the young Tsahn’s command.
	</p>
	<p>“Jrena!” the young Candentia called, “wait up!” and she shot forward, diving after the other southern girl. 
	</p>
	<p>“Jrethian! Tsahn! Come on!” another young boy, whom Aurelius recognized to be his own younger self, urged at the other two boys that glided in suit steadily behind, “let’s catch up with them!” he called before disappearing under the white mist.
	</p>
	<p class="p">Aurelius, gazing after his own figure on the screen, remembered that day. It was when Candentia visited clan Syarchia with the general of the swordsmen for diplomatic occasions, and Aurelius was given the chance to tag along. It was his first time seeing the land he heard Candentia gush over after her previous visits throughout the years.
	</p>
	<p class="p">Another young southerner had flown up to the young Syarchia prince’s side. “Tsahn,” he called, his voice almost drowned out by the wind, “your Hyacinthous friends sure are pretty wild.” 
	</p>
	<p>“They are. And Jrena there isn’t helping,” he called back, “can’t control your twin, Jeth?”
	</p>
	<p>The southern boy, Jrethian Norst, replied with a fancy spin.
	</p>
	<p>“Control her? What are you talking about? Do you even know Jen? That would be a mission impossible to do,” he exclaimed, before diving into the clouds, after the others.
	</p>
	<p>“Keep up if you can!” 
	</p>
	<p>The screech of the large birds above cut through the clouds, as Tsahn held back his cape, close to his sides, with one swift movement, and shot after his friends. And the scene suddenly changed, from the Syarchia sky to the shores below Annyo city, void of color and deprived of light.
	</p>
	<p class="p">“Aurelius!” a cheerful voice of a young boy called. 
	</p>
	<p>Heather and Candor both heard the sharp breath drawn from the boy sitting in between them. 
	</p>
	<p>“Aurie, come!” the boy’s voice echoed through the classroom. Silver and golden particles of light shimmered and floated around as softly as tiny snowflakes dancing on a gentle breeze, while the screen of condensed dream fragments scintillated, as color and figures started to fill up the shadows once again. 
	</p>
	<p>Aurelius recognized the young boy, aging about thirteen or fourteen, walking, hands in pockets, towards the source of the joyous call— it was his younger self, smiling ever so gently as he approached the boat awaiting him.
	</p>
	<p>“We were waiting for you!” the young voice of Tsahn Aouthyerhl laughed, “we thought you’d forgotten!” Aurelius’ stomach churned once again, as the image of a young girl entered Tsahn’s view, glowing in the light.
	</p>
	<p>“I, in fact, was not,” the young girl rolled her eyes, slightly pouting, “it doesn’t matter if Aurie remembers or not.” Her plump lips were just as Aurelius remembered. 
	</p>
	<p>He jeered silently at himself, recalling how smitten he was with her at that age.
	</p>
	<p>“Oh, Cadi, you can’t even handle the wind well enough on your own if I didn’t join you,” the young Aurelius smirked as he grabbed onto the boom beneath the sails and towered over the Candentia and Tsahn, who were sitting in the pit of the small sailboat. The young Aurelius on the screen had on a pair of gray spenders over a pure white shirt that flapped against the sea wind; his raven black hair was also blown back, revealing his well-balanced eyebrows.
	</p>
	<p class="p">“Damn, you were handsome,” Candor commented, “but at the same time… also already such a jerk— ow!” he held the back of his head, the spot throbbing from a sudden blow, “Rosaline!” he accused, “what was that for?”
	</p>
	<p><i>“Shh—”</i> Rosaline gave him a devilish smile, dark eyes glaring.
	</p>
	<p class="p">“You need me, and you know it,” the young Aurelius said with a smug smile. 
	</p>
	<p>“Oh, you wish,” on the screen, the young Candentia glowered with a competitive smile, her large gray eyes glaring up into his amber ones, daringly, “want to make a bet?”
	</p>
	<p><i>“No— not now—”</i> the young Tsahn cut in between the two, slightly whining. “<i>Please,”</i> he begged, his hazel eyes round and innocent, “you two, just stop the bickering this once, please! For me?” His honey-colored stands fluttered uncontrollably as he tried to brush them out of his face. 
	</p>
	<p>The young Aurelius laughed softly, while the young Candentia sighed loudly. A smile slipped past her lips, however, and she took out several clips from the rim of her black high-waisted shorts, pulled the young Tsahn over and combed back his wild fluffs of hair, pinning the strands in place. She then exchanged a glance at the young Aurelius, who shrugged. 
	</p>
	<p>Truce it is.
	</p>
	<p>“Fine,” the young Candentia said, as she pulled her own ashy locks of curls into a black ponytail, “we are doing this for you.”
	</p>
	<p>“Come on,” she said, two fingers gesturing for the young Aurelius to jump down, to which he complied with a chuckle.
	</p>
	<p>“Let’s go,” he gave them a tilt of his chin, the burnt amber eyes glinting with mischief. 
	</p>
	<p class="p">So the rumors were true, that the three, in fact, were close friends back then— Kye gazed at the large screen of Tsahn Aouthyerhl’s sweet dream, mesmerized by the waves and laughter. He smiled however, unaware, as he took in the familiar sight of the shores.
	</p>
	<p>“Looks like Tsahn and Kye here have something in common,” professor Coulnaur laughed softly.
	</p>
	<p>The class chuckled in agreement as they watched the similar scene of three people surfing on the waves, although Tsahn’s dream contained more craziness to it, as the small boat flipped wildly in circles; the young Aurelius and Candentia took turns steering the small vessel and controlling the wind, the whole time barking with maniacal laughter.
	</p>
	<p>“I didn’t know you guys could laugh like that,” Candor said to Aurelius, to which Rosaline agreed in silence. Aurelius, on the other hand, contrary to the brightness of his younger self, looked troubled and tired at the moment.
	</p>
	<p>On the platform, professor Coulnaur pushed the rim of his glasses as he watched the scene change. “This is interesting,” he said, “this, comparing it with Kye’s dream, is a perfect demonstration of how the timeline in dreams can be altered according to how the subject reflects his or her own memory.”
	</p>
	<p>“Although I’m guessing most of you can tell the simple difference, can anyone summarize the difference in time frames of these dreams of the two subjects here?” he asked the class.
	</p>
	<p>Masie Desill, the blonde girl in the front row, shot her hand up again, faster than anyone else. Professor Coulnaur chuckled, “looks like our Masie here sure knows a lot about this class,” his low voice sounded. “Yes? Miss Desill,” he called on her, “please, do tell.”
	</p>
	<p>“Anek’s dream was in the perfect sequential method,” she stated the obvious, “whereas Aouthyerhl’s, is the exact opposite. And this could be known judging by the age of the characters, who seems to still be our late first heir— Candentia Hyacinth, and our classmate— Aurelius Solicas, if I’m not mistaken” she uttered out with bold confidence.
	</p>
	<p>“‘Late’ first heir—” a rumor Aurelius didn’t want to be reminded of, and yet Masie Desill had said it without stuttering, making him wince at her words.
	</p>
	<p>“...good, miss Desill,” Professor Coulnaur said, although this time his smile was stiff, “there is one thing I ought to correct you.”
	</p>
	<p>Masie Desill looked confused.
	</p>
	<p>“Don’t take this personally,” Hashier Coulnaur said slowly as he took off his glasses and started to clean them with a handkerchief that was previously in the pocket of his vest. “But about your comment on the first heir of Hyacinthous, I would recommend you refrain from using the word ‘late,’ as her death is not yet confirmed,” he sounded serious, “we are training to be royal servants of the throne, so there is a baseline where we have to stand, which is not going about, engaging in street gossip. Is that understood?”
	</p>
	<p>“Yes, sir,” Masie’s face was pale.
	</p>
	<p>“Just a small reminder,” Professor Coulnaur smiled at her gently before saying to the class, “and that goes to all of you, do you understand?”
	</p>
	<p>“Yes, sir,” the class murmured.
	</p>
	<p>“Back to what Miss Desill said here,” the professor changed back to the subject, “it looks like our Tsahn Aouthyerhl here is having a reverse journey through his flashbacks.”
	</p>
	<p> And sure enough, just as Masie said, the children on the screen appeared to be a bit younger than before, all around the age of nine or ten— around the time when the Syarchia prince first arrived at the citadel.
	</p>
	<p>The class cooed when two young children, both with round, deep eyes, appeared on the glowing screen. 
	</p>
	<p>“You sure played a big part in Tsahn’s dreams,” Candor said, nudging Aurelius with his elbow, recognizing the children.
	</p>
	<p>“The princess, too,” Heather murmured.
	</p>
	<p>“Yeah, Candentia Hyacinth, too,” Candor agreed, and added to Aurelius— “I knew you three were childhood friends, but it never occurred to me that your history ran so far back.” 
	</p>
	<p>Aurelius hummed absentmindedly.
	</p>
	<p>The teacher seemed to have given a new instruction to Kye, who had raised an eyebrow upon a sense of disappointment. Although Aurelius Solicas and Candentia Hyacinth did appear, the dreams were nothing near his expectations— far too pure and innocent to his liking. And the marvelous sight of the Syarchia realms made his heart ache in a way that he wished that he never saw the sights.
	</p>
	<p>“Time for the darkness—” as professor Coulnaur had said, it was time to put out the bright light; Hena Tannor, who was still in charge of changing the types of dreams, poked the screen with just her finger tips. Hashier Coulnaur smiled to himself as a groan rumbled through the dark classroom— it seems like his students were enjoying the class. Kye Anek’s arms ached as he tried hard to control the raging smoke, as the dream fragments swirled and danced around wildly. He was on the verge of collapsing— just as professor Coulnaur was about to intervene, the air stilled. 
	</p>
	<p>The class watched in confusion as the screen showed once again, the southern lands, where the grass swayed peacefully, as Syarchia bathed under the golden sun. 
	</p>
	<p>“Did they fail the enchantment?” Heather breathed, for everything seemed so tranquil, as if in a wonderful dream.
	</p>
	<p>“No,” Aurelius said quietly, “the enchantments had been performed perfectly. This is one of his nightmares.”
	</p>
	<p>“How so?” she chirped softly, her head tilted to the side.
	</p>
	<p>“You’ll see,” Aurelius replied. Although his tone was gentle, his body was tense, and his eyes held a dark expression of discomfort, as if he knew what was coming. 
	</p>
	<p>The point of view, this time, was also through Tsahn’s eyes. Judging from the height, Tsahn Aouthyerhl might’ve still been just a child, around the same age as he was in the previous scene— only nine or ten years old. The small boy giggled innocently as he held tightly to the hands of two adults. He winced slightly at the sudden sharp pain that shot up in his thin arms, but quickly put the discomfort behind his back, and pranced happily between his parents.
	</p>
	<p>“Do you think the Hyacinth family will like us?” he asked, head tilted up. The upper faces of the adults were slightly blurred by the bright light. Tsahn squinted— his mother’s lips seemed to quiver for a bit, and she took a shaky breath.
	</p>
	<p>“Yes, my dear,” her gentle voice, full of warmth, filled the room, “they are all looking forward to seeing you.”
	</p>
	<p>“Are they here already? Are we going to meet them right now?” The little Tsahn had been told numerous stories about the royal Hyacinth family of the foreign land, and he was eager to meet them.
	</p>
	<p>“Son,” the deep voice of the Syarchia chief sounded, and Tsahn’s eyes turned to his father— the man’s eyes were also masked by the light, though a sad smile seemed to tug his lips behind his mustache. “You will be going to the Great Land to meet them,” he said.
	</p>
	<p>“We will?” the little Tsahn asked, his small hands gripping his parents’ more tightly in delight. “Are we going to fly there?”
	</p>
	<p>His mother stopped abruptly and turned to her husband. “I can’t do this,” she gasped.
	</p>
	<p>“I know it’s hard, but it’s the best choice,” the chief’s low voice strained.
	</p>
	<p>“The best, but not the <i>only</i> choice,” his wife pleaded, “it’s not too late to change our minds. I’m sure the Hyacinths will understand. It’s our only son, after all. I can’t stand sending him away and alone.”
	</p>
	<p>The young Tsahn looked at his parents, confused. He shifted uncomfortably between the tension. 
	</p>
	<p>“Sending <i>who</i> away?” he asked.
	</p>
	<p>“That would make us appear unfaithful,” the chief of Syarchia shook his head, not hearing his son’s inquiry. 
	</p>
	<p>“And besides, if you think about it, it’s actually a great opportunity for him,” he stressed, “how many chances in a lifetime do you think that one can stumble upon the possible future of being betrothed to the <i>first heir of Land Hyacinthous?</i>” He emphasized the last few words.
	</p>
	<p>“But what if <i>that</i> doesn’t happen?” Tsahn’s mother retorted with slight anger in her voice, “are you telling me that I have to see you send off our only son, alone— to some foreign land just for some gamble?”
	</p>
	<p>“His hawk will accompany him,” the chief tried, voice tired, “a different environment might actually do the both of them good. We can only hope that— ”
	</p>
	<p> “That reminds me—” she cut in, hissing, “what about his duties as the chief’s son? Don’t tell me that because he is weaker than his peers in the meantime, you are giving up on him already. His hawk will eventually fly! If you just let them grow in their own time…”
	</p>
	<p>“As I was saying,” the chief said darkly, “staying at Land Hyacinthous might actually benefit our boy. The blood runs in him, too, or have you forgotten?”
	</p>
	<p>Tsahn’s mother pursed her lips together.
	</p>
	<p>“We’ll decide on his future and place in the clan the next time we see him again,” he said gravely, “and hope that his hawk would be ready to spread its wings by then.”
	</p>
	<p>“What are you guys talking about?” the young child tugged on his parents’ arms, causing them to look down. His mother knelt down, her whole face now visible as she held both Tsahn’s arm steady and stared into his eyes. She was a delicate woman, about the age of forty at that time, with small linear tattoos under her sharp eyes. Her hair was worn loose, with one strand in the front braided on the side— the soft locks were the same warm honey brown as her son. 
	</p>
	<p>Kye Anek thought, despite himself, that apart from the slim nose and thin lips that were different from the southern boy, the beautiful woman looked very much like the grown, female version of Tsahn Aouthyerhl. 
	</p>
	<p>“My fledgling,” she said, “my son. My baby.” Her tone was gentle, though the voice was laced with evident pain. 
	</p>
	<p>The young Tsahn cupped the sides of her face with his small hands, and gazed at her worryingly. His mother’s usual happy and playful demeanor was replaced by a grim and sorrowful expression, and he searched her clear hazel eyes for an answer. 
	</p>
	<p>“What’s wrong?” he asked in his childish voice. 
	</p>
	<p><i>“What’s wrong?”</i> he repeated when his mother didn’t answer, only to pull him into a tight hug. Tshan patted his mother’s back gently, trying to calm her down, and looked up at his father, asking for the third time, “what’s wrong?”
	</p>
	<p>“Tsahn,” his father said after some silence, “you are to go to land Hyacinthous on your own.” 
	</p>
	<p>“On my own?” Tsahn echoed, mind blank, “are we not going together?”
	</p>
	<p>The soft brown feathers decorating his mother’s hair, as well as her hooped earrings, quivered, and brushed against Tsahn’s cheek as she tightened her arms. <i>“I’m sorry. I’m sorry,”</i> she repeated.
	</p>
	<p>“Oh!” she cried, looking up at the chief accusingly, “how I regret not stopping you from presenting that crystal to the Hyacinths!”
	</p>
	<p>“My love, that was ages ago—” Tsahn’s father strained, opening his mouth to explain, but stopped and swooped down instead, pulling his wife and son into his embrace. “Now, now,” he comforted, “I know it’s hard.”
	</p>
	<p>“Will we ever get to see our son again?” she gasped.
	</p>
	<p>“That goes without saying,” he assured calmly; he was patient, even though he had the same conversation with her numerous times before, “I’m sure that they will let Tsahn visit us in no time. You don’t think the people of your mother’s land are that cruel, do you?”
	</p>
	<p>She closed her eyes and took a deep breath, calming herself down.
	</p>
	<p>“Tsahn, look at me,” the chief said, as he gently pulled the boy out of the mother’s tight grasp with one strong arm, all the while running a soothing hand down her back. The little boy looked into his father’s eyes obediently. The chief of Syarchia was a strong looking man with dark features. He had dark brown hair with golden highlights, and bright, upturned, yellow eyes that resembled those of an eagle’s.
	</p>
	<p>“This is a special mission you have to do on your own,” the low voice rumbled through the silent classroom, “although your mother and I won’t be able to accompany you to the foreign lands, we will be here, at home, waiting for you.”
	</p>
	<p>“This is an important mission that can allow our clan to remain powerful. And only by remaining powerful can we keep your mother and our people safe. We are all relying on you, son. Do you think you can do that?”
	</p>
	<p>“Yes,” was Tsahn’s whimper. Despite his status as the prince of the clan, he was somehow weaker than most of his peers, not to mention that his hawk hadn’t been able to fly yet, which left him with a huge lack of confidence. The young Syarchia prince desired a chance to prove himself, more than anything, and if going to the foreign lands was the way— he was determined to make his parents proud.
	</p>
	<p>It was rather a peaceful nightmare, so as Kye Anek thought, and he took the chance to observe the chief and chieftess of clan Syarchia. It was obvious that the son of chief Aouthyerhl got his straight nose and full lips with defined edges from his father, and other softer features from his mother. The chief’s sharp features and wild yellow eyes were not far from his memory of the images representing the people of clan Syarchia, but the chief’s wife, whom Tsahn Aouthyerhl resembled, had more of a tenderness to her air, and the color of her hazel eyes were more likely the shade of a Hyacinthous descendent. Although Kye was oblivious, his observations, however, were on point— as Tsahn’s mother is in fact half-blooded, with the mixture of both Syarchia and Hyacinthous blood flowing through her veins.
	</p>
	<p>“Be strong, my boy,” the chief’s voice echoed, and the class watched as the young ten-year old got pulled away from his parents, onto the carriage, and away from his home.  
	</p>
	<p>“For there is a huge responsibility that you carry on your wings.”
	</p>
	<p>The dream fragments flashed violently as Tsahn watched his homeland become smaller and smaller, and his little heart was torn to pieces. Although his sobs were quiet, the dangerous red and black flashes of the nightmare indicated that the boy was in tremendous pain. The soreness in his arms stung as his body shook violently, and he hugged himself in the corner of the large carriage, trying to breathe properly, as he came to the realization that, his wings, which he yearned to spread across the sky one day, had been nipped, even before he could learn to fly.
	</p>
	<p>“It’s about time we return his dreams back,” professor Coulnaur said gently, putting a firm hand on kye’s shoulder. After being pulled out of a trance, Kye noticed that, apart from some soft sniffles, the room was caught in a dead silence. 
	</p>
	<p>Hena Tannor had already poked the flashing fragments one last time, and only dark smoke swirled around, over Tsahn Aouthyerhl’s head. Kye nodded at the professor and started the spell that should return the dream fragments to their owner.
	</p>
	<p>A blood curdling scream exploded all of a sudden, and the class watched in horror as the dark smoke spread over the classroom, instead of returning to the sleeping boy on the bench.
	</p>
	<p>Heather gave a short yelp, ducking, as a snake-like figure came shooting towards her. She squeezed her eyes shut and clung to Aurelius— who had jumped up the second he noticed the fast-approaching shadow, and with one arm shielding Heather, he held a book, transverse, in his other hand and slashed at the figure as it plunged at them. The dense smoke diffused upon contact, then dissipated.
	</p>
	<p>Back on the platform, the professor had held a power shield with his arms crossed in front of his chest, just in time to protect his students from the sudden impact. Even from behind professor Coulnaur’s shield, Kye Anek and Hena Tannor had been blown over. They scrambled back to their feet, bewildered. Kye started to panic— was it his fault that the dream exploded? Did it do any harm to Tsahn?
	</p>
	<p>“Don’t worry,” professor Coulnaur said in a calm, soothing voice, and he lowered his arms. The light in his earring glowed as his palm held a globe of light on the side. “Although it is rare,” he said, as he walked slowly down the platform, and up the steps of the classroom, beckoning for Hena and Kye to follow him. “This is one of the complications that sometimes happen, if the nightmare is an overly traumatizing one that haunts the subject frequently.”
	</p>
	<p>“Is Aouthyerhl going to be okay?” Kye asked as he caught up with the professor, he looked over his shoulder and saw that the southern boy was trembling, limbs tied to the bench, still unconscious. Shadows swirled through the large room, making it seem as if a tornado was passing through.
	</p>
	<p>“Raging storms will pass,” professor Coulnaur replied, “and haunting nightmares will end.”
	</p>
	<p>“He will be alright,” he assured his students, as he stood on the table of the middle row, center of the classroom “and in the meantime, what we can do is to sit back, protect ourselves from getting hurt, and observe.” 
	</p>
	<p>Bright light excreted from his hand as he held the screeching shadows back for a moment. “Class!” he bellowed over the thundering howls, “be prepared to practice your basic defense skills! Power shields, shadow rebounding, physical skills, you name it! The basic rule is NOT TO LEAVE YOUR SEATS! And don’t worry,” he winked at his students, “they are only phantoms made of dreams, and can’t physically hurt any one of you. There’s nothing to be afraid of.”
	</p>
	<p>“What about Tsahn?” Hena asked frantically, after the professor had sat her and Kye Anek down in two vacant seats.
	</p>
	<p>“Oh, right,” the professor pushed his glasses upwards, “while you are busy practicing your defense skills, don’t forget to <i>observe</i>.” he said with a smile, voice rising above the racket, “look for every little detail and try finding out what might calm our subject. And if anyone succeeds in finding a way, we might just be able to end the storm before he suffers through the whole nightmare, which is—,” he chuckled, “a nightmare.”
	</p>
	<p>“He’s crazy,” Candor whispered to Aurelius.
	</p>
	<p>The light in their teacher’s hands faded away and Masie Desill, Kye Anek, Hena Tannor, Rosaline Everbear, Candor Nyek and Aurelius Solicas, along with the other trainees, watched in horror as the dark, dream fragments came to life around them. Most of them recognized the scene this time, which was the main castle grounds of the citadel of Annyo. And a blood curdling scream of a child echoed once again, making the glass windows rattle behind the curtains.
	</p>
	<p><b><i>“Candentia! Aurelius!”</i></b> the thin shriek of a ten-year old sounded from the darkness, sending chills down Kye Anek’s spin. He churned his head to take a glance at the general’s son that sat a few rows behind him. Several heads had also turned towards him. The boy’s face was pale and he gripped the sides of the long desk, dread and confusion filled his dark amber eyes. 
	</p>
	<p>Aurelius knew by instinct of which incident was replaying before his eyes, but what shook him was that no matter how hard he tried, he seemed not able to recall what happened.
	</p>
	<p>“Aurelius,” the young child’s voice sounded, this time sobbing. “Wake up!” 
	</p>
	<p>Most of the trainees had come to the obvious conclusion that the sobbing belonged to the ten-year old self, of the boy that now lay unconscious on stage.
	</p>
	<p>“Go away!” the young Tsahn’s voice shrieked out. “Please!”
	</p>
	<p>“Help!” he screamed again, as if something was approaching him. The dream fragments were still moving in blurry shapes, making it hard to distinguish what was going on. “Candentia!”
	</p>
	<p>“Don’t hurt them!” a different voice shouted, and it sounded like a young girl. The slashing of flesh being stabbed, and a scream, was heard just seconds after.
	</p>
	<p>A sudden change of brightness, followed by dead silence, suddenly took over the classroom. Aurelius’ breath hitched as he took in what lay before his eyes—
	</p>
	<p>Candentia Hyacinth, rather still a child, stood motionlessly over heaps of shadows; red blood, still warm, dribbled down the icy dagger in her hands, and dripped onto the marble floor. The eleven year old stood frozen, face blank as she stared at the heap of black collapsed at her feet.
	</p>
	<p class="pend"> 
		Two steps away, a young Tsahn Aouthyerhl was on the floor, face lifted and stained with blood; his yellow hazel eyes wide open, pupils contracted and full of fear. He held tight to a young Aurelius Solicas, who lay limply on top of him, unconscious and bleeding.
