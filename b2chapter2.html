	<h2 class="chapter title">The Tricheri</h2>
<div class="chaptercontent">
	<p><b class="b">A</b>n uproar of whistles and cheers broke out as a young man with ashy ombre hair and gray colored eyes strided onto the main stage in the atrium of the Tricheri. The stage, situated in the center of the first floor, could be seen by all the people that crowded the railings on all open floors of the lower part of the building. The man stood on the side of the stage, held a finger to his veil-covered lips, and waited. The people, eyes trained to the stage, settled down. He glided gracefully to the center of the other dancers, the silver bells on his ankles tinkling with every step. 
	</p>
	<p> Cheers erupted as the anticipated performance began. 
	</p>
	<p>The thin, so fabric flowed with the dancers as they swayed to the music. With a graceful prance, the gray-eyed man swept forward and leaned toward the audience. The veil that covered the lower part of his face fluttered up as he blew a handful of red flower petals out to the crowd, revealing the glossy smile underneath. Squeals of delight slipped past the lips of some girls near the stage as they nudged each other, exchanging mischievous glances.
	</p>
	<p>A pair of silver cuffs, along with bangles, hung over his wrists, where a thin black layer of silk ran underneath, covering his forearms and the back of his hands, leaving only his fingers and palms bare. His gray shirt was parted in the middle, revealing his chest, and tucked into black pants that flowed just above his ankles. The long, sheer dark gray cloak that draped around his shoulders was trimmed with red linings, and the length of the sleeves covered only his elbows. As he twirled and swayed, the cloak flowed around him like smoke in rain. 
	</p>
	<p>The rhythm of the drums accelerated, and the smile under the gray veil grew wider. His hips moved in time with the beat as the other dancers slowly sunk away, kneeling down by the edges of the square stage. The audience gasped as he drew his dagger from its sheath, the silver sequins and tiny bells that lined the upper rim of his veil jingled as he held the blade between his teeth. With a sudden flick of his wrist, he sent the dagger spinning through the air— with a step and a turn, he caught it effortlessly with his hands held to his back.
	</p>
	<p>“Whoosh,” a sharp sound cut through the air, as an arrow shot towards him. With a swi movement, the incoming object was shattered into millions of pieces by the silver dagger in his hand. A girl with a bow in hand leapt over the railings of the second floor and landed onto the stage. She was about one head shorter than the man and had the same hair color of starry ombre gray. The beads and crystals in her tiny braids sparkled as her short hair swayed over her bare shoulders. Her round almond eyes glared into the sharp siren eyes of the man as they stepped circles around one another, movements fluid and slow. The crowd whistled when the girl flung her bow and arrows aside and drew out the daggers that hung to the sides of her thigh. Her slitted ivory dress flowed suggestively around her bare legs, and the thin silver chains that hung from the black garters hugging her thighs loomed and shimmered. 
	</p>
	<p>The crowd, mesmerized, watched with open mouths, as the two dancers leapt at each other with feline grace, their blades clashing and sending sparks as the music amplified. As they swirled, the veils floated around their faces, the silver sequins and tiny bells jingling with every movement. The two daggers that were previously in the girl’s hands were soon taken into possession by the man. With a hand on the hip and a dagger to the throat, the man held her still, facing the audience as their act came to an end. The man seemed to whisper something in her ear that made her raise one eyebrow. The crowd held their breath, once again, as she sank on one knee and backed silently into the corner to join the other crouching dancers. 
	</p>
	<p>Cheers broke out once again as the man started dancing with three daggers in hand— spinning, throwing and catching them as he leapt across the stage. The sheer fabric of his cloak floated, resembling so waves of ocean surfaces being blown by the wind. The red jewels of his long silver earrings sparkled in the light. As the music reached its climax, he took a final spin and with one hand raised, dagger glinting, he sank to the floor with a bow. The audience erupted into applause as he stood back up, the siren eyes smiling as they took in the adoration of the crowd.
	</p>
	<p class="p">Up on the fih floor, looking down from the railing, the matriarch of The Tricheri clapped and nodded with satisfaction. Good performance, good money.
	</p>
	<p>Down on the first floor, lying face first and alone at the large table in the corner, Aurelius Solicas stirred and opened his eyes. 
	</p>
	<p class="p">The world spun crazily, as the sound of thumping drums, wooden flutes and ringing bells made their way past Aurelius’ drowsiness and into his ears, the entangled sound of laughter and music amplifying as he gradually came to his senses. He groaned soly as he tried to hold himself up with his elbows. It felt as if his inner organs were having a blast of their own. He knitted his brows, trying to recall the number of glasses he had before passing out. He frowned—it turned out that he had one too many.
	</p>
	<p>Aurelius— for the first time in his life, had passed out from drinking.
	</p>
	<p>“What time is it?” he said to himself as he sat up and rested his forehead on the back of his hands. 
	</p>
	<p>“Could it be that I’m not used to Western wine?” he murmured, for his tolerance for alcohol was usually considered to be high above average back on Land Hyacinthous.
	</p>
	<p>“Tsahn, can you hand over some water?” Aurelius managed to say. With one hand supporting his forehead, he reached out next to him with the other, and patted around— only to find that the seat beside him was, in fact, empty. Head heavy, Aurelius glanced sideways. The person that once occupied the spot was nowhere to be seen.
	</p>
	<p>He groaned in frustration. 
	</p>
	<p>“He better not be lost,” Aurelius muttered, “there’s no way I passed out and he didn’t.”
	</p>
	<p>“His tolerance for alcohol is no way better than mine. Hell, he’s even worse than Cadi—”
	</p>
	<p>“Shit, what if he’s drunk and got kidnapped? Is he in danger? Should I go looking for him?”
	</p>
	<p class="p">He paused and listened. 
	</p>
	<p class="p">During his rambling, the melody in the background had changed into a much gentler tune. Amongst the cheers, Aurelius could hear the loud voices of the ship crew and their captain. It sounded like they were enjoying the show.
	</p>
	<p>Tsahn might be with them, Aurelius thought.
	</p>
	<p>“I need water,” he sighed, feeling nauseous. His head was pounding.
	</p>
	<p>As he squeezed his eyes, he thought he heard the sound of tiny silver bells coming nearer.
	</p>
	<p>“Thirsty much?” a low voice sounded from behind. 
	</p>
	<p>Aurelius felt a sudden warmth beside him as something so brushed against his right arm. 
	</p>
	<p>It was the sleeve of a stranger, which Aurelius recognized immediately to be made of “skiet,” a sheer material fabricated only in the far west, and is often used to be made into outfits for dancers. Candentia herself had a few skiet cloaks which she adored and had oen worn them around despite the disapproval of some palace officials, as it wasn’t considered appropriate for their first heir to run around in foreign material made for dancers. 
	</p>
	<p>“Drink up,” the low voice said in Aurelius’ ear, pulling him back to reality. Someone had sat down and taken Tsahn's vacant seat. And before Aurelius could answer, or raise up his heavy head, a glass of water was gently pushed between his elbows and into his sight. The back of the hand in Aurelius’ sight was covered with a slick black fabric that hooked over the middle finger. Mind hazy, Aurelius stared at the fingers that hovered the glass— they were long and slim, and decorated with silver rings.
	</p>
	<p>He turned his head slightly and glanced up, only to see a pair of dark gray eyes gazing back at him. 
	</p>
	<p>He froze. It can't be.
	</p>
	<p>“Cadi…, Canden…, Canden—,” he sputtered. 
	</p>
	<p><i>“Get a hold of yourself,”</i> he thought to himself, still not fully recovered from the booze, <i>“it’s not like she's the only gray-eyed person in the world.”</i>
	</p>
	<p>He turned around clumsily and looked the person over.
	</p>
	<p>Judging by the outfit of the other, Aurelius could tell, even with his brain all foggy, that this was supposedly one of the male dancers that worked in the Tricheri.
	</p>
	<p><i>“Yup, and she’s not a dude, and definitely not a dancer”</i> Aurelius thought, <i>“although, there are times she could pass for one.”</i> A dude, he meant.
	</p>
	<p class="p">The stranger leaned back, unfazed by the intense gaze of interrogation, and crossed his legs— the silver bells around his ankles tinkled. Under the long, dark gray skiet cloak that draped over his squared shoulders, an open gray shirt could be seen— tucked loosely into the tight waistband of the flowy black pants. Through the sheer material, it wasn’t hard to notice the thin silver webs of jewelry hanging from the armlet that was wrapped around the man’s toned biceps, just below the deltoid muscle. A so gray veil hung from the sequins and tiny bells that lined under his eyes, covering his lower face, and making it hard to guess his age. 
	</p>
	<p>It wasn’t the alluring attire nor the seductive air of the other that held Aurelius in a trance, but the cat-like eyes that gazed back confidently into his eyes, in the <i>color</i> that made his head spin. Normally, if he was sober, Aurelius would’ve broken eye contact long ago. But under the influence of alcohol, he even forgot how to breathe properly.
	</p>
	<p>The dancer tilted his head aer being scanned from head to toe, a small smirk formed behind the veil, the red jewel that hung from his earring glistened.
	</p>
	<p>“Like what you see?” he teased. His voice was husky but drenched with honey.
	</p>
	<p>Aurelius sucked in a thin breath— even the tone reminded him of a feeling he wanted to forget long ago. He turned away and gulped down the glass of water.
	</p>
	<p>The dancer chuckled. “Flustered?” he asked. 
	</p>
	<p>“Stop with the teasing,” Aurelius said with drunken honesty, unintentionally pouting a little. 
	</p>
	<p>“Sorry,” the dancer's low laugh rang out— a sound of so thunder in early spring. The slim fingers of his reached for the empty cup. “Bad habit of mine. Don't take it to heart.”
	</p>
	<p>Aurelius shook his head. “Actually, I'm sorry for staring,” he returned the apology.
	</p>
	<p>The rings of the dancer glinted as he traced the rim of the glass slowly with his long fingers.
	</p>
	<p>“It's alright. I'm used to people staring all the time. Besides, better the amber eyes of a pretty face than the perverted ones on an old man's, ain’t I right?” he drawled.
	</p>
	<p>Aurelius blinked with confusion. Do dancers always talk like this? Or is this just the way how western folk talk?
	</p>
	<p>What’s your name? Aurelius was just about to ask before he got interrupted— “who is tissst?” Tsahn's sharp voice suddenly appeared from behind. Aurelius felt a pair of arms snake around his neck, and was enveloped by a sudden warmth and the strong smell of alcohol. He couldn't see, but standing behind him, above his head, Tsahn was sending sideway daggers at the dancer with slanting eyes.
	</p>
	<p>He, along with the crew, was back from the stage. They sat down and continued with the food. 
	</p>
	<p>“You’re still eating?” Aurelius asked, still feeling nauseous, “how come you can still eat?”
	</p>
	<p>“We were just starting, dear lad,” one of the older crew members called from across the table.
	</p>
	<p>“You passssed outh just aer the second drint,” Tsahn told him from above. 
	</p>
	<p>Hot and uncomfortable, Aurelius tried to shake Tsahn off, but Tsahn grasped onto him like a hawk perched on a tree branch. “You're drunk, too,” Aurelius said.
	</p>
	<p>“Aaamn not,” Tsahn slurred. He rested his chin on the top of Aurelius’ head as he glared up at the stranger, who had already stood up. “Now, now,” the dancer chuckled in his low melodic voice, “why don't you sit your pretty ass down and I'll fetch you some water.” “Don’t talt to me like dath” Tsahn spat, his face scrunched with disgust, “who do you tink you ahrl?” 
	</p>
	<p>The dancer merely smiled a devilish grin and leaned in close to Tsahn’s face, “you’ll learn,” he smirked. 
	</p>
	<p>Tsahn fell silent as he let the pair of gray eyes bore into his soul. “Ca…denty?” he asked, voice meek and uncertain, “gray eyes… so clear… prrrretty…” he slurred. And without a warning, he had reached out his hands and pulled the other’s face so close that their foreheads were touching. His yellow hazel eyes welled up with tears as he gazed intently into the gray eyes he longed to see for so long. 
	</p>
	<p>“I misssssed you,” he whispered. 
	</p>
	<p>The dancer, stunned by the sudden action, stared blankly into the hazy eyes of the other’s. Aer a second or two, he came back to his senses and shut his own eyes, blocking the intense stare of the hawk-like eyes. He gently tore Tsahn’s hands away from his own face and stood back up, chuckling soly.
	</p>
	<p>“I’m sorry to disappoint,” his low laugh rang out like brass bells swaying to the gentle wind.
	</p>
	<p>“— But I’m not the person you both wanted me to be.” 
	</p>
	<p class="p">It seems that the sailors were commonly used to strong western wine, for aer many mugs down their throats, they were still able to talk quite clearly, blabbering away with one another. They hooted and clapped with delight when the gray-haired dancer returned to their table with two new bottles of wine in his hands. He was followed by two other girls that also appeared to be in full Tricheri-dancer-attire. The shorter one of the two had long curly blonde hair, while the taller one had short hair that barely reached her shoulders— it was the same ashy ombre gray as the tall male dancer. The girls both held a bottle in their hands respectively.
	</p>
	<p>Tsahn stared— it felt like he had seen the gray-haired girl somewhere.
	</p>
	<p>“Zayda!” the captain boomed when he saw the gray-haired girl, “that was a hell of a performance you and Zephyr here just did!” Ah, that’s right. The girl was the one that leapt down from the inner balcony of the second floor, and onto the stage with a bow in hand. She was the one who did the dagger dance with the mysterious young man— who Tsahn now realized to be the very dancer he mistook as Candentia for his gray eyes. The dancer named Zephyr seemed to have felt his gaze because he looked Tsahn’s way and gave him a wink. How embarrassing. Tsahn’s face was flustered as he looked away in haste. How could he mistake someone so different for Candnetia?
	</p>
	<p>It seemed that the crew all were familiar with the two gray-haired dancers, as they chatted with them as if they were old friends, and asked questions about all the gossip that happened during their time away in the winter. 
	</p>
	<p>“They’ve both been here a while,” the blonde dancer said, noticing Tsahn glancing at the two gray-haired dancers, “they were already gems of the Tricheri before I came to work here.” She had come over to the side of the table where Aurelius and Tsahn sat, and was filling up their mugs as the other two dancers did the same with the others. 
	</p>
	<p>“No, no, no,” Aurelius said hastily, as he grabbed his mug clumsily, “no more wine for the both of us.”
	</p>
	<p>“Relax,” she laughed, the sequins and silver bells on her veil jingling as she did. 
	</p>
	<p>She leaned in between them and whispered in their ears— “you’ll be fine. Zephyr asked me to replace the wine with water in this bottle and give it to you. Sweet of him, isn’t it?” she hummed, “he asked me to take good care of you boys.”
	</p>
	<p class="p">“Are gray eyes that common around here?” Aurelius suddenly asked the blonde girl, his eyes trained on the gray-haired dancer Zayda, who stayed on the other side of the table, refilling the empty mugs while patiently answering the showering of questions the crew drowned her in.
	</p>
	<p>“Why— I don’t know for sure, actually,” she answered, “I’m quite new to this area. Why don’t I ask those two for you? They both are gray-eyed, though they are said to be twins, so I’m guessing it’s more of their lineage?” 
	</p>
	<p>“Zephyr! Zayda!” the blonde girl called out in her sweet voice, catching the two dancer’s attention along with the other sailors’.
	</p>
	<p>“Our handsome friend here wanted to ask if gray eyes are common around the west.”
	</p>
	<p>Zayda, upon the question, froze and lowered her head, as if trying to hide her eyes. But Aurelius had already noticed their clear gray color, which was the reason he asked the small blonde in the first place. Zephyr, on the other hand, looked over boldly.
	</p>
	<p>“Why?” he mused. 
	</p>
	<p>The blonde girl looked at Aurelius. She, too, wanted to know why. “We’re searching for a lost friend,” Tsahn blurted out, “and she has the most unique gray eyes we’ve ever seen.”
	</p>
	<p><i>“Ah—”</i> Zephyr’s eyes twinkled as he licked his lips from under the veil, “is that why you both mistook me as—” he tilted his head— “‘Cadi,’ is it?”
	</p>
	<p>“Cadenty!” a voice cried out from the other side of the table. It was Kune— relieved to finally be able to join the conversation. He was feeling a bit let out, although he did find it amusing to witness the drunken side of Aurelius and Tsahn. 
	</p>
	<p>“It’s Cadenty, isn’t it?” he asked excitedly, “I oen heard that name come up when we were on the ship.”
	</p>
	<p><i>“Cadenty—”</i> Zephyr said slowly in a low tone, a small smirk was beginning to form under the gray veil.
	</p>
	<p>“Lost girls and lost boys,” the captain sighed, “these incidents are happening more and more frequently ever since the North started making trouble… even the Hyacinth heir is said to be lost, if not captured… such dark times.” He shook his head with sadness.
	</p>
	<p>The blond girl leaned in once again, this time her veil brushed the side of Aurelius’ cheek. 
	</p>
	<p>“Tell me,” she drawled in his ear, “what's she like?”
	</p>
	<p>“Who?” Aurelius said thickly. He pushed her shoulder gently, creating some distance.
	</p>
	<p>The lips under the veil curved into a small smile as she pushed a loose strand of blond hair behind her ear and over her shoulders. The jewelry that hung against her collar bone glistened in the light of the Tricheri.
	</p>
	<p>“The lost girl you are searching for,” she answered— a tone as sweet as berry wine.
	</p>
	<p>“Why should he be bothered telling you?” Tsahn reached out his hand to block her from getting anywhere near Aurelius. “Aww— tell us,” Zephyr coaxed, “and we might be able to keep an eye out for you.”
	</p>
	<p>“Yeah! Tell us!” Kune begged, he was dying to know what the mysterious girl was like.
	</p>
	<p>Aurelius looked sideways at Tsahn, who merely shrugged, still drunk. He sighed. It won’t be any harm telling, and besides, like Zephyr said, it might be useful for helpful eyes in the Tricheri. And to be honest, under the influence of alcohol, the music and gentle voices clouded his judgment, and he eventually gave in.
	</p>
	<p><i>Give the audience what they want.</i>
	</p>
	<p>“Well,” Aurelius murmured, “she’s like winter, gentle but deadly.” “Yeah, she’s cold,” Tsahn chimed in, with a new mug in hand, “but charming and pretty.”
	</p>
	<p>“She has a tender heart,” Aurelius started, “and a husky voice drenched with honey.”
	</p>
	<p>“What about her face? Her body? Her hair? And her eyes?” the blond girl asked, “we’ll need information of what she looks like, or else how are we gonna find her?”
	</p>
	<p>“Exactly,” Zephyr chimed in, eyeing Zayda with a smirk, who shied stiffly, clearly uncomfortable with the conversation. “How about this?” he asked, laying out a proposal to the drunken lads, “aer you tell us what she looks like, you come back here tomorrow and we’ll tell you if we’ve seen her. And if we haven't, I’ll try and get you jobs here at the Tricheri, and you can keep an eye out for yourselves.” “That’s brilliant!” the captain clapped, “weren’t you two trying to find places to work at? This could be the perfect solution!” The crew cheered. But Aurelius felt uncertain. Even with a drunken mind, he didn’t dare trust the dancer. Tsahn, on the other hand, was overjoyed and started to describe what his memory of Candentia looked like— Aurelius, led by the nose, eventually joined in.
	</p><br>
	<p class="p"><i>“What did you do that for?!”</i> — a cry could be heard in one of the dorm rooms of the male dancers’, up on the sixth floor of the Tricheri. The Tricheri is a broad seven-storied building with a squared atrium in the middle. Only the lower four floors were made into the restaurant, while the remaining three were built with countless rooms. The two lower floors of the upper part of the Tricheri were made into private rooms for VIP customers; dorm rooms and facility rooms for the staff; while the penthouse is restricted to the matriarch of the Tricheri.
	</p>
	<p>There is a reason why people called her “the matriarch” and not “the boss,” “the owner,” or the “restaurateur,” as being the head of one of the most famous resorts on the west coast of the land, she not only engages in the restaurant and entertainment business, she also owns a large portion of trades of the main merchant ship company along the coast. Her wealth, her success, along with her well known merciless personality, earned her the name of “the matriarch.” 
	</p>
	<p class="p">“Can you hear what they are arguing about this time?” the blond dancer that served the table along with Zephyr and Zayda asked. She was holding her ear to the sliding door of Zephyr’s dorm.
	</p>
	<p>Zephyr’s three other roommates shook their heads. They had been “kindly asked out” of their own dorm room, yet again, by the “unapproachable Zayda.” Zephyr and Zayda— both ombre gray-haired and gray-eyed, looked extremely alike, but were of opposite personalities. Zayda, who seemed to be so gentle around her friends, often smiled a cold, ghosty smile that made her seem distant and unapproachable to the customers, and although the other dancers loved to hug her here and there, it was well known that Zayda never initiated any intimate contact with anyone; her twin brother— Zephyr, on the other hand, didn’t seem to have any close friends, but would flirt with almost everyone in his sight, and as an opposite to Zayda, people feared him and rarely dare touch him, although the devil himself was quite the touchy and clingy type. It was said that the twins were orphans that survived a shipwreck, and had wandered the lands, homeless, until they barged in the Tricheri by mistake and ran into the matriarch, who instantly found potential in them with her unique taste, and took them under her wing— and the twins have been loyal servants to her ever since. 
	</p>
	<p>The twins, alluring and mysterious, were the center of most of the gossip around the Tricheri, and were also known for their inner quarrels. Zayda, who seemed to be the more sensible of the two, often barged into Zephyr’s room and shooed the other three boys out— and the twins would argue in low voices for hours. 
	</p>
	<p class="p">“Keep your voice down, dear sister,” Zephyr laughed his devilish laugh, sitting on the raised platform beside the window, “people are straining their ears outside of our door, trying to hear what we are talking about.” 
	</p>
	<p>Zayda turned, strode over to the door and pulled it open. <i>“...shoo, go to sleep,”</i> she said to the crowd that had gathered in a pile near the door. They crawled and scurried away sheepishly. She went back in and pulled the door close behind her with a thud. “So, <i>dear brother</i>, can you explain now— what did you do that for?!” she hissed, putting emphasis on the <i>“brother”</i> part. 
	</p>
	<p>Zephyr merely laughed and beckoned for his said sister. She inched closer, the glint in her gray eyes was a mixture of anger, confusion, and— was that dread? He tugged on her sleeve as he tilted his head and looked up at her innocently.
	</p>
	<p>“They were drunk,” he said coaxingly, “and it was just for a little bit of fun.”
	</p>
	<p><i>“Fun?”</i> Zayda wheezed in disbelief, <i>“just a little bit of fun?”</i> “What’s wrong with that?” Zephyr licked his thin lips and pulled her closer, “it’s not like they were sober enough to recognize you.” “But what about you telling them to come back for jobs?<i> At the Tricheri? Really?</i> They’ll be sure to recognize me then,” the girl glared down at the gray siren eyes and crossed her arms. 
	</p>
	<p>“What’s the harm of it? It’s just a matter of time. And I doubt they will, this early on, even if they do—” Zephyr’s voice trailed off when he noticed that the gray eyes glaring down at him were drenched in fear.
	</p>
	<p>“What,” he whispered, “are you so afraid of, Candentia?” Her name slipped past his lips before he could stop himself. He felt the other freeze for a second before her voice, dripping with venom, sounded lowly, “do I really have to explain? Huh? <i>Lansher?” </i>He remained silent. It had been a while since he heard his real name roll off the tongue of the other. If it weren’t for the tone, he reckoned he would’ve enjoyed it and felt at home.
	</p>
	<p>Zayda— Candentia went on, “first of all, do you know the danger we would be putting the boys in if they found me before we fully gained our powers back? Their heads would be hung on spikes if anyone found out. We’re still being hunted down by the demon in the North, for goodness sake.”
	</p>
	<p>Zephyr— Lansher, let go of the older and pouted. He flung his legs onto the platform he was seated on. <i>So it was for the sake of the boys aer all. </i>He gazed at his own reflection on the window. 
	</p>
	<p>He actually wanted to take revenge on the two for sneaking the second princess of Hyacinth to a hiding spot, which made him fail the mission he had prepared all his life, and the reason why he had ended up in this miserable state to begin with.
	</p>
	<p class="p"><i>Might as well kill them myself before anyone does. 	</i>
	</p>
	<p class="p">“Don’t you dare put a finger on either one of them,” his companion warned, reading his mind. He huffed.
	</p>
	<p>“And second, you know how they’ll react when they find out who you are,” she said soly.
	</p>
	<p>He turned his head, a smile resurfaced on his face and his eyes lit up with glee, “so you’re worried about me?” he smirked.
	</p>
	<p>She rolled her eyes, “hell, they’ll kill you, you know.”
	</p>
	<p>“Not if I kill them first.”
	</p>
	<p>“As I said, don’t you dare,” she sounded serious, as if saying— I’ll kill <i>you</i> if you ever dare hurt them.
	</p>
	<p>“Okay,” he mused, “I won’t, in the meantime. Plus, I actually find them quite entertaining. You should’ve been there when your friend Tsahn pulled me close and stared into my soul,” he laughed, reminiscing the moment— “Such pretty eyes.”
	</p>
	<p>Candentia smirked— “don’t fall in love with them so easily, now,” she said, snapping him out of a trance.
	</p>
	<p>He raised one eyebrow, “you know me,” he drawled, “I don’t fall in love.” 
	</p>
	<p>She merely looked at him with her gray doe eyes— full of mockery. He shied under her gaze and asked, “there’s another reason though, right?”
	</p>
	<p>Candentia sighed— “they’ll never forgive me,” she said simply. To be honest, she wasn’t ready to meet the boys just yet— not in this state. When they were in the dungeon of the North, she and Lansher had their powers suppressed, or taken away, they weren’t for sure. They didn’t know if it counted as a curse or a blessing, as it turned out rather an advantage for them when they fled the land, due to becoming undetectable beings with their powers gone. Their journey to finding a way to revive it had been going on for almost two years, with only half of the work done. Candentia shuddered at the thought of facing her childhood friends. Would they ever understand? She doubted it. If they were to switch positions, she knew she herself would never forgive either one of them if they disappeared for such a long time without any contact, not even mentioning a sign of life.

	<p><i>“You couldn’t even care enough to even bother letting me know that you’re alive, could you?”</i> she could imagine Aurelius’ icy gaze. She shook her head, trying to get the image out of her mind.
	</p>
	<p>Back at the Tricheri, he looked a little older than she last saw him— his hair was longer and his features had grown sharper, and had he grown taller? In fact, both Aurelius and Tsahn seemed to have grown more mature since she last saw them on Aestas’s sixteenth birthday, — “...Aestas,” she murmured suddenly with dread. Now that the boys are both here, who’s to take care of her dear sister?
	</p>
	<p>“She’s going to be turning eighteen years old the next season…,” she said to herself, as she paced around the room. If Aurelius and Tsahn were to recognize her, and to be kind enough to spare her life, maybe she should at least ask them the favor of sending a secret message to Aestas.
	</p>
	<p>How was she going to face them? Would they try to kill Lansher? If she were them, she definitely would— Candentia’s mind was spiraling with thoughts when the sound of Lansher’s soft singing made its way to her ears. She turned and tilted her head. The taller had walked up from behind and towered over her. He grinned as he spun her around playfully. Was he singing what she thought it was? 
	</p>
	<p><i>“Curvy body, tiny waist, wide shoulders, thick thighs,”</i> he hummed— voice husky but sickeningly sweet. 
	</p>
	<p>“Goodness me, they called your shoulders wide. And they look just fine to me,” he said as he patted her shoulders. 
	</p>
	<p>She swapped his hands away and rolled her eyes— Yup, he was definitely singing about the conversation with the drunken Aurelius and Tsahn.
	</p>
	<p>“Shut up,” she snapped.
	</p>
	<p>“Wavy curls, ash black hair, dark lashes, doe eyes,” he continued, ignoring her glare.
	</p>
	<p>He stopped mid-twirl— “apart from the hair, they’re actually getting close, don’t you think? Oh, but the part of the doe eyes… more like slanting and glaring all the time. Ouch! See? Exactly like they are at the moment.” 
	</p>
	<p>He rubbed the spot on his arm where Candentia pinched down hard, and continued to sway around her gracefully. The gray-eyed girl watched, feeling defeated.
	</p>
	<p><i>“Husky voice, honeyed tone, plum lips, ghosty smile—” </i>
	</p>
	<p>Lansher smiled, “Well, we do speak and smile alike.”
	</p>
	<p><i>“Heavy gaze, icy stare, gentle touch, and sweet, sweet lies—”</i> “Well, well, well, what have you done to them, dear sister?” he mused. 
	</p>
	<p class="p">Lansher was still smiling when his roommates crawled back into the room aer Candentia had stormed out. And he was still humming the sweet low tune when they turned off the lights—
